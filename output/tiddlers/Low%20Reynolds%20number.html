It just means that no force is needed to cause that acceleration</p><p>In the zero Re limit, if the swimmer accelerates (say by varying the velociy of the corkscrew), and if it has a finite mass, the fluid will exert a net force on the swimmer, and thus the swimmer will exert a net force on the fluid, momentarily creating a Stokelet component. If we somehow had a small but very heavy swimmer with a large thrust too, it would then create a Stokelet velocity field for a significant period of time.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/robotics-n-intelligent-systems/multiscaleroboticlab-dam/documents/microrobotics/HS2015/Purcell1977.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Life at low Reynold's numbers</a></p><p>Happel and Brenner book: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="file:///home/guillefix/Dropbox/COSMOS/Physics/Fluid%20mechanics%20and%20thermodynamics/%5BJohn_Happel,__Howard_Brenner__(auth.)%5D_Low_Reynol(BookZZ.org).pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Low Reynolds number hydrodynamics (book) </a></p><p><u>Reciprocal theorem</u></p><p>The reciprocal theorem allows one to determine results for one Stokes-flow field based upon the solution of another Stokes flow in the same geometry, i.e. having the same boundaries but different boundary conditions.</p><p>See <em>A physical introduction to suspension dynamics</em>.</p>
