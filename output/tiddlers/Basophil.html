ated, the subcellular location(s) of this important precursor to the newly generated inflam-
matory mediators has generally been attributed to the plasma membrane. Given the
ubiquitous distribution of lipid bodies in mammalian cells and our demonstration by
electron-microscopic autoradiography of [ 3 H]arachidonic acid within them (Figure 39),
we think that lipid bodies may serve as a major source of this important precursor for the
stimulus-provoked generation of eicosanoids by oxidative cascades.</p>
