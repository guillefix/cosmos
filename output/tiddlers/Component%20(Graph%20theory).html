<p>A <em>component</em> is a subset of the network for which all pair of vertices have at least one path, and which is maximal (i.e no extra nodes can be added that preserve this property). A connected graph has only one component, while a disconnected one has more than one.</p><p>The adjacency matrix can always be written in block diagonal form with blocks corresponding to components.</p><p><u>Components in directed networks</u></p><p><em>Weakly connected components</em> are components of a directed network ignoring the direction.</p><p><em>Strongly connected components</em> have a path between any two vertices <em>in both directions</em>.</p><p>Acyclical graphs can't have  strongly connected components with &gt;1 vertex since, they would necessarily include a cycle.</p><p><em>Out-components</em> are all the vertices reachable from a certain vertex, including the vertex itself.<br><em>In-components</em> are all the vertices from which one can reach a certain vertex, including the vertex itself.<br></p><p>Both of these are  identical for all vertices in a strongly connected component.</p>
