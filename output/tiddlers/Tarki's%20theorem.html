<p>There is no way of expressing the notion of <em>truth</em> in sufficiently powerful <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Formal%20system">Formal system</a>s, such as TNT.</p><p>If there was a way, one could represent <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Epiminede's%20paradox">Epiminede's paradox</a>, with a formula with G number T.  If the Tarski formula T actually existed, then it would be a statement about natural numbers that is both true and false at once (or neither)!  If we believe this is a ridiculous state of affairs, then we have to undo our assumption that the formula TRUE{a} exists . Thus, there is no way of expressing the notion of truth inside TNT. Notice that this makes truth a far more elusive property than theoremhood, for the latter is expressible. </p><p>So this assumes, a priori facts about how truth works, I guess as axioms of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Logic">Logic</a></p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Godel%2C%20Escher%2C%20Bach">Godel, Escher, Bach</a>, page 581</p>
