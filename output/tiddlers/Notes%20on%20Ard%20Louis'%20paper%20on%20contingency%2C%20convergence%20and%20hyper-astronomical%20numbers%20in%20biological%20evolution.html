No</p><p>Feed fixed input length codes with a short pefix corresponding to the map (the conditon of it being short, in particular much shorter than the inputs, could be the quantitiative condition corresponding to Ard's observation that the map should be &quot;simple&quot;). Then feed this to a Turing Machine (TM). Results will be of varying length. You expect shorter lengths to be more common because:
Input to the TM is approximately like feeding random fixed-length codes (because prefix code is much shorter than input, by assumption, and inputs are random).
If we reverse the TM, hmm no it doesn't work. Well the output will be an input that produces a fixed-length string of bits for the reversed TM, but the distribution in outputs is not random now?
Are there more fixed length strings that will produce shorter codes? Seems unlikely. But im missing he many to one nature of the mapping in this description. Or hmmmm the little prefix code should make this happen somehow? What kind of &quot;prefix codes&quot; can do this?</p>
