These are produced whenever vibrations are excited in the air. Because these require motion, it makes sense that most sounds in Nature are due to the more dynamical aspects of it: <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Life">Life</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Fluid">Fluid</a>s</p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Ethology">Ethology</a> for the immense variety sounds that <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Animal">Animal</a>s produce.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Fluid">Fluid</a>s include <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Liquid">Liquid</a>s and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Gas">Gas</a>es.
