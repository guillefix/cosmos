<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Reinforcement%20learning">Reinforcement learning</a> method which tries to computes the exact <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Value%20function">Value function</a>. The name refers to the fact that in general, this requires storing the value for  each state (or state-action pair). Therefore, this can only be applied to finite-MDPs. </p><p>The other alternative, which can be applied to larger and more difficult problems is to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Value%20function%20approximation">approximate the value function</a>, for instance using a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Artificial%20neural%20network">neural network</a></p>
