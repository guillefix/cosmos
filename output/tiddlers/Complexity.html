For instance, complexity is related to “incompressibility” in information theory
and computer science. In dynamical systems, complexity is usually measured by
the topological entropy and reflects roughly speaking, the proliferation of periodic
orbits with ever longer periods or the number of orbits that can be distinguished
with increasing precision. In physics, the label “complex” is in principle attached to
any nonlinear system whose numerical solutions exhibit a chaotic behavior. Neurologists claim that the human brain is the most complex system in the solar system,
while entomologists teach us the baffling complexity of some insect societies. The
list could be enlarged with examples from geometry, management science, commu-
nication and social networks, etc.</p><p><em>from book on Permutation complexity by Amigo</em></p><p>Complexity can be seen in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Chaos%20theory">chaotic systems</a>, and, depending on interpretation, in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Randomness">random</a> ones.
