<p>Computational biology has two distinct branches: knowl-
edge discovery, or data-mining, which extracts the hidden
patterns from huge quantities of experimental data, form-
ing hypotheses as a result (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Bioinformatics">Bioinformatics</a>);</p><p>and simulation-based analysis,
which tests hypotheses with in silico experiments, providing
predictions to be tested by in vitro and in vivo studies.</p><hr><h3 class=""><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://moleculamaxima.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://moleculamaxima.com/</a></h3><p>Create new exciting organisms with just a few lines of code
