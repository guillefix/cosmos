ciphers. Block ciphers tend to simultaneously encrypt groups of characters, whereas stream ciphers operate on individual
characters of a plaintext message one at a time. In another classification, which is based on the method of distribution
of secret key, one classifies cryptosystem into two classes, the <strong>symmetric</strong> (private) key and the <strong>asymmetric</strong>
(public) key cryptosystems. In a symmetric key cryptosystem, the key used in the decryption process is the same as
(or can be easily obtained from) the key used in the encryption process.</p><h2 class=""><u>Symmetric cryptosystem</u></h2><h3 class=""><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Cipher">Cipher</a>s</u></h3><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Unconditionally%20secure">Unconditionally secure</a> cipher</p><p><u>Historical ciphers</u></p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Substitution%20cipher">Substitution cipher</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Shift%20cipher">Shift cipher</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Affine%20cipher">Affine cipher</a></li></ul><p><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Stream%20cipher">Stream cipher</a></u></p><p><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Block%20cipher">Block cipher</a></u></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aHkqB2-46k#=23m" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intro</a></p><h2 class=""><u>Assymetric cryptosystem</u></h2><p>Aka <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Public-key%20cryptography">Public-key cryptography</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#RSA%20cryptography">RSA cryptography</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Digital%20signature">Digital signature</a></p><h2 class=""><u>Cryptographic protocol</u></h2><hr><p>fully homomorphic encryption: an extremely exciting new class of methods, the rst of which was announced by Gentry [60] in 2009, for performing arbitrary computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting the data.
