<p>Surface science is the study of physical and chemical phenomena that occur at the interface of two phases, including solid–liquid interfaces, solid–gas interfaces, solid–vacuum interfaces, and liquid–gas interfaces. It includes the fields of surface chemistry and surface physics.</p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Materials%20science">Materials science</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Condensed%20matter%20physics">Condensed matter physics</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Chemistry">Chemistry</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_science" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_science</a></p><h2 class=""><u>Surface chemistry</u></h2><h2 class=""><u>Surface physics</u></h2><h3 class=""><u>Fluid dynamics at interfaces</u></h3><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.fl.21.010189.000425" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Colloid Transport by Interfacial Forces</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Interfacial%20forces">Interfacial forces</a></p><p><u>Fluid/fluid interfaces</u></p><p>Governed mostly by (apparent) discontinuities in stress, particularly surface tension.
