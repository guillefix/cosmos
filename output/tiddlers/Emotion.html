It is kind of a summary of wisdom from past experiencies. Hm this is interesting.. If we are guided by emotions too much then our Q function will learn by trying to amplify the positive emotions it encodes, this may produce a positive feedback loop, which sounds like <em>addiction</em> to me. If however, we ignore emotions too much, we are not making use of this awesome machine learning algorithm we have built in in our brain, and may get stalled in philosophical analysis too often in life, by trying to logically deduce everything.</p><p>In fact, modern <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Artificial%20intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a> trends seem to show that deep learning, and heuristics based learning are more powerful than the older symbolic/logic approach to AI.

Hm, of course, this is just a fuzzy representation, but I think I would swap the terror and amazement branch, maybe... It'd be interesting to see the logic behind this better though.

From Freud I got the idea of the unconscious mind: that there were things going
on in one's brain that one didn't have direct access to. Poincaré, made it clear
that much of his serious problem solving occurred in his subconscious, and I felt
this was very common in problem solving of all kinds in the sciences and the
arts
This view was one important reason for my later rejection of &quot;Expert Sys-
tems&quot; as a significant step toward Artificial Intelligence. Expert Systems were
(at best) expressions of peoples' conscious thought, which was, I felt, a very
small fraction of human problem solving activity
Other implications: Memory is what you invent to explain the things that
you find in your head. Over the years, the &quot;facts&quot; in this paper will be gradually
revised as I reread my research notes
Explanations that people give for their own behavior are not to be taken too
seriously including discussions in this paper</p></blockquote><hr><p><img src="http://orig14.deviantart.net/f321/f/2011/010/9/9/100_expressions_by_izanethex-d36wolo.png"></p>
