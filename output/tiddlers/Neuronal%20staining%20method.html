<p>Traditionally studied via staining methods:</p><ul><li>Nissl stains. Mostly nucleus visible.</li><li>Golgi impregnation techniques. Only about 1% of neurons impregnated. Makes most of the cell visible.</li><li>Weigert stain for myelin.</li><li>Reduced-silver method.</li><li>Staining of degenerate elements.</li><li>Retrogade staining. One can stain all neurons whose axons terminate on a given region, using materials taken at the dendrites and then transported to the cell body.</li><li>Anterograde staining. Find the regions which the axons of neurons in a certain zone reach, using materials absorved by the body and transported to the axon terminals.</li><li>Intreacellular dye injection. Shows more of the cell than Golgi impregnation techniques.</li><li>Histochemical staining. Identify cells by particular chemicals they contain.</li><li>Metabolic staining. Staining that depends on the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Metabolism">Metabolism</a> of the cells.</li></ul>
