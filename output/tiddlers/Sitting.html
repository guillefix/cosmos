<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sitting</a> is a basic human resting position. The body weight is supported primarily by the buttocks in contact with the ground or a horizontal object such as a chair seat. The torso is more or less upright. Sitting for much of the day may pose significant health risks, and people who sit regularly for prolonged periods have higher mortality rates than those who do not.</p>
