<p>Nash embedding theorem guarantees that any sufficiently smooth Riemannian manifold can be realized in a Euclidean space of sufficiently high dimension (<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1969989" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">source</a>). An embedding is not necessarily unique; two different realizations of a Riemannian metric are called isometries .
