simplistic (see [36–39] for some recent discussion). For the GP map bias in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Arrival%20of%20the%20frequent">Arrival of the frequent</a>,  the reason for this repetition is not a contingent
common genetic history, nor the Allmacht (german for <em>omnipotence</em>) of selection <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/all-sufficiency-of-natural-selection-a-reply-to-herbert-spencer/oclc/37315932" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[40]</a>, but
