<p>Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zfsk7ty/revision/4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zfsk7ty/revision/4</a></p><p><img src="http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zm3jtfr/large"></p>
