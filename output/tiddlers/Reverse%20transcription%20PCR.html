<p><strong>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</strong></p><p>RT-PCR is used to clone expressed genes by reverse transcribing the RNA of interest into its DNA complement through the use of reverse transcriptase, using oligo-DT, which substitutes for the role of primers. Subsequently, the newly synthesized cDNA is amplified using traditional <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Polymerase%20chain%20reaction">PCR</a>.</p><h3 class=""><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Real-time%20RT%20PCR">Real-time RT PCR</a> (qRT-PCR)</h3><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction</a></p>
