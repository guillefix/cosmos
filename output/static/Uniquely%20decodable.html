<p>A <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Code">Code</a> is called <strong>niquely decodable</strong> if its extension is nonsingular (see definitions at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Code">Code</a>). Basically, if there is a unique decoding of the encoded message; any encoded string in a uniquely decodable code has
only one possible source string producing it.</p>
