<p>Kadanoff’s variational <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#RG%20scheme">RG scheme</a> introduces coarse-grained auxiliary, or “hidden”, spins that are coupled to the physical spin systems through some unknown coupling parameters. A parameter-dependent free energy is calculated for the coarse-grained spin system from the coupled system by integrating out the physical spins. The coupling parameters are chosen through a variational procedure that minimizes the difference between the free energies of the physical and hidden spin systems. This ensures that the coarse-grained system preserves the long-distance information present in the physical system. Carrying out this procedure results in an RG transformation that maps the physical spin system into a coarse-grained description in terms of hidden spins. The hidden spins then serve as the input for the next round of renormalization. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3831" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An exact mapping between the Variational Renormalization Group and Deep Learning</a> with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Restricted%20Boltzmann%20machine">Restricted Boltzmann machine</a>s</p>
