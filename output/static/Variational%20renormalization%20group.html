<p>&lt;p&gt;Kadanoff’s variational &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#RG%20scheme&quot;&gt;RG scheme&lt;/a&gt; introduces coarse-grained auxiliary, or “hidden”, spins that are coupled to the physical spin systems through some unknown coupling parameters. A parameter-dependent free energy is calculated for the coarse-grained spin system from the coupled system by integrating out the physical spins. The coupling parameters are chosen through a variational procedure that minimizes the difference between the free energies of the physical and hidden spin systems. This ensures that the coarse-grained system preserves the long-distance information present in the physical system. Carrying out this procedure results in an RG transformation that maps the physical spin system into a coarse-grained description in terms of hidden spins. The hidden spins then serve as the input for the next round of renormalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3831&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;An exact mapping between the Variational Renormalization Group and Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Restricted%20Boltzmann%20machine&quot;&gt;Restricted Boltzmann machine&lt;/a&gt;s&lt;/p&gt;</p>
