And there were other people whose job was to optimize them, so they did analysis of their space-time trajectory to find the optimal sequence of movemen, and precise path that made them maximally efficient.</p><p>See: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Time_and_motion_study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Time_and_motion_study</a></p><p>See also: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5PwheNZvQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5PwheNZvQ</a></p><p>I have done similar optimizations in my life, at some points, creating a shower kata, and a cooking kata, of sorts xD</p><p>See also, another instance of movement optimization: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gcKDKG_uC4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gcKDKG_uC4</a></p>
