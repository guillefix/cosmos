<p>&lt;p&gt;incredulity towards meta-narratives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Lyotard#/The_Postmodern_Condition&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Lyotard#/The_Postmodern_Condition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Postmodernism&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Postmodernism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that no one seemed to agree on what, if anything, was real and everyone had their own perspective and story.[22] We have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of our aspirations, beliefs and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives.[23] For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of 'language-games' found in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.[24]&lt;/p&gt;</p>
