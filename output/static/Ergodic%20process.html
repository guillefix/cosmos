which the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Strong%20law%20of%20large%20numbers">Strong law of large numbers</a> holds. For finite alphabet processes,
ergodicity is equivalent to the convergence of the kth-order empirical
distributions to their marginals for all k.</p><p>See section 16.8 from Cover&amp;Thomas</p>
