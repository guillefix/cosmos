Onsager
gave in 1944 a complete solution of the problem in zero external magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in three dimensions, Istrail has
shown [108] that essentially all versions of the Ising model are computationally intractable across lattices and thus the
3D Ising model, in its full, is NP-complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For another model with many interesting connections, see &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Spin%20glass&quot;&gt;Spin glass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
