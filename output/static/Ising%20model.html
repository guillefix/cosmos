gave in 1944 a complete solution of the problem in zero external magnetic field.</p><p>But in three dimensions, Istrail has
shown [108] that essentially all versions of the Ising model are computationally intractable across lattices and thus the
3D Ising model, in its full, is NP-complete.</p><p>For another model with many interesting connections, see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Spin%20glass">Spin glass</a></p>
