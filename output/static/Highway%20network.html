Based on this analysis we propose Recurrent Highway Networks, which extend the LSTM architecture to allow step-to-step transition depths larger than one.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07771.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HIGHWAY AND RESIDUAL NETWORKS LEARN UNROLLED ITERATIVE ESTIMATION</a> – <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Skip-connection">Skip-connection</a>s</p>
