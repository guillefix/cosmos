Based on this analysis we propose Recurrent Highway Networks, which extend the LSTM architecture to allow step-to-step transition depths larger than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07771.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HIGHWAY AND RESIDUAL NETWORKS LEARN UNROLLED ITERATIVE ESTIMATION&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Skip-connection&quot;&gt;Skip-connection&lt;/a&gt;s&lt;/p&gt;</p>
