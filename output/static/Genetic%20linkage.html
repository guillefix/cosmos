<p>Genetic linkage is the tendency of alleles that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction.</p><p>Genes whose loci are nearer to each other are less likely to be separated onto different chromatids during <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Chromosomal%20crossover">Chromosomal crossover</a>, and are therefore said to be <strong>genetically linked</strong>. In other words, the nearer two genes are on a chromosome, the lower is the chance of a swap occurring between them, and the more likely they are to be inherited together.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Genetic_linkage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Genetic_linkage</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY5bf7dEJes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Linkage map (vid)</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYkcrsvEhRM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Linkage mapping (vid)</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYkcrsvEhRM#t=5m40s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">More details on linkage</a></p>
