Furthermore, BCC, and FCC appear only in metals, at least, when looking at pure element crystals (see <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table_(crystal_structure)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Periodic table (crystal structure)</a>)</p><h2 class=""><u>Metal groups</u></h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Alkali%20metal">Alkali metal</a>s</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Alkaline%20earth%20metal">Alkaline earth metal</a>s</li></ul><h2 class=""><u>Reactions</u></h2><h3 class=""><u>with water</u></h3><p>As a general rule, if a metal reacts with cold water, you get the metal hydroxide. If it reacts with steam, the metal oxide is formed. This is because the metal hydroxides thermally decompose (split up on heating) to give the oxide and water.</p><h3 class=""><u>with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Acid">Acid</a></u></h3><p>Metals react with acids at different rates, depending on how reactive the metals are.
