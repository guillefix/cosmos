Such a process is assumed to occur in cognitive models like ACT-R (Servan-Schreiber and Anderson, 1990),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Reinforcement%20learning&quot;&gt;Reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt; rewards probably play a role&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special, internally-generated signals are needed specifically for learning problems where standard unsupervised methods—based purely on matching the statistics of the world, or on optimizing simple mathematical objectives like temporal continuity or sparsity—will fail to discover properties of the world which are statistically weak in an objective sense but nevertheless have special significance to the organism (Ullman et al., 2012).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
