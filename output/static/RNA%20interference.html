<p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression, typically by causing the destruction of specific mRNA molecules. </p><p>Two types of small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules – <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#microRNA">microRNA</a> (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) – are central to RNA interference. In particular, RNA interfernce uses artificial miRNA, known as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#RNAi">RNAi</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/RNA_interference" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/RNA_interference</a></p>
