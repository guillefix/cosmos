A paradox resolved in <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.2.031009" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this paper</a>, where they show that some processes, while continuous at exactly the transition point, still exhibit infinitely many discontinuous jumps in an arbitrary vicinity of the transition point: a <strong>Devil’s staircase</strong>.</p><p>This staircase is in fact stochastic, as the jump points and sizes are stochastic random variables. This stochasticity is present even in the thermodynamic limit, and that is what gives rise to the non-self-averaging property.</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s4haYQr.png"></p>
