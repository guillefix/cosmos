Our framework brings together three key ideas—compositionality, causality, and learning to learn—that have been separately influ-ential in cognitive science and machine learning over the past several decades (19–22).</p><h2 class=""><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Causality">Causality</a></u></h2><p>naturally captures the abstract “causal” structure of the real-world processes that produce examples of a category. </p><h2 class=""><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Learning%20to%20learn">Learning to learn</a></u></h2><p>Learning proceeds by constructing programs that best explain the observations under a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Bayesian%20statistics">Bayesian</a> criterion, and the model “learns to learn” (23,24)  by developing hierarchical priors that allow previous experience with related concepts to ease learning of new concepts (25,26). These priors represent a learned inductive bias (27) that abstracts the key regularities and dimensions of variation holding across both types of concepts and across instances (or tokens) of a concept in a given domain. </p><p>In short, BPL can construct new programs by reusing the pieces of existing ones, capturing the causal and compositional properties of real-world generative processes operating on multiple scales. </p><h2 class=""><u>BPL</u></h2><p>BPL defines a generative model that can sam-ple new types of concepts (an“A,”“B,”etc.) by combining parts and subparts in new ways. Each new type is also represented as a genera-tive model, and this lower-level generative model produces new examples (or tokens) of the con-cept (Fig. 3A, v), making BPL a generative model for generative models. The final step renders the token-level variables in the format of the raw data</p><p>Could we decode representations structurally similar to those in BPL from brain imaging of premotor cortex (or otheraction-oriented regions) in humans perceiving and classifying new char-acters for the first time?</p>
