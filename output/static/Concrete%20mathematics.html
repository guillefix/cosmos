Things like: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk#t=3m37s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk#t=3m37s</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk#t=9m17s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk#t=9m17s</a></p><p>Things like that, may not be noticed. But in great education, just like in great filmmaking, the best things aren't conciously noticed, because they tap into all the intuitive subconcious information processing power of your senses.
Such animations are actually conveying information. Information, which in typical material would be omitted, because it's considered easy/trivial, and also because it would take too much to state explicitly in words/text (and it would be more boring also). Such omissions cause, unnoticedly at first, gaps which soon lead to confusion.
Because this video doesn't suffer from that, that's why it's so much clear than all the many other videos about neural nets in YB.</p><p>I hadn't seen people take such skillful advantage of animation to explain difficult math concepts, since The Mechanical Universe., and that was in the 80s!! That's why when I found out about 3blue1brown, I was su f**cking happy. Finally, someone was doing this again.</p><p>I started AugMath to help people</p>
