See comments there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have developed over the years a strong sense that having a unified personality and mind is the right thing to do. However, last year a friend challenged this preconception to me, and I've been learning a bit about hypnosis, dissociative personality dissorder, multiplicity, role-play, etc. Super interesting. I'm still far from certain, but now I appreciate that there may be value in all these things. In the simpler terms, having several modes/personalities can allow you to explore different ways of being in parallel. Nietzche said that to become a good man one has to &amp;quot;fake it&amp;quot; first. Also, being able to act and think in a variety of ways can be good when living in a high-variance environment...
In any case, I still feel very unconfortable when doing something like role-play, or &amp;quot;faking&amp;quot; stuff. I find it very hard to lie (guess this is an Asperger-like symptom). But I'm very interested by all this, and want to continue learning and trying new things. â€“ 6/04/2018, me&lt;/p&gt;</p>
