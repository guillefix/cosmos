<p>Electrolysis is the process by which ionic substances are decomposed (broken down) into simpler substances when an <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Electric%20current">Electric current</a> is passed through them. Electrolysis is used to extract and purify metals.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zk96fg8/revision" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zk96fg8/revision</a></p><ul><li>Positively charged ions move to the negative electrode during electrolysis.

Furthermore, if the cathode is made of carbon (most common case), the carbon is more reactive, so a layer of metal would first need to form to give electrons to the hydrogen.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zk96fg8/revision/5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Basic electrolysis calculations</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zk96fg8/revision/7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electroplating</a></p>
