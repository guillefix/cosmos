I.e. just describes the behaviour of the <em>mean</em> quantities of interest. Can get such behaviour by applying the method of steepest descents to the partition function.</p><p>A mean field model is essentially a simplified model in which <strong>every degree of freedom finds itself in the same environment as every other</strong>; in other words, <strong>local spatial fluctuations have been discarded</strong>. It is precisely these fluctuations that drive much of the interesting behavior of many phase transitions, so mean field models are often a poor guide to understanding behavior (called the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Critical%20phenomena">critical behavior</a>)at or near a transition. On the other hand, they’re often fairly reliable at providing insights into thelow-temperature properties of a system—its order parameter and broken symmetry, and the low-energy excitations that determine its thermal properties. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youtu.be/ov4KJwX2us0?t=52m11s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Video</a>. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youtu.be/ov4KJwX2us0?t=1h1m3s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mean field is typically exact for systems with infinite range interactions</a></p><h3 class=""><u>Approaches</u></h3><p>There are different ways in which the mean field approach can be realized, which for technical reasons turn out to be essentially equivalent.</p><ul><li>One such way is to <strong>extend the range of the interactions to infinity</strong>.
