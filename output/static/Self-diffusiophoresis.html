<p>In <strong>Self-diffusiophoresis</strong> (a kind of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Self-propelled%20particle">self-propulsion</a>), a particle itself produces the compound it interacts with, through <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Diffusiophoresis">Diffusiophoresis</a>, causing it to move.</p><p>Self-phoretic particle. Creates something that it then attracts or repells, and that something then pushes the surrounding fluid (creating a slip velocity). The particle is then indirectly pushing on the fluid.

Another example is a particle that facilitates the polymerization of a biopolymer (e.g. actin), which creates a gradient because individual monomers diffuse, whereas the polymers do not. The latter process is one possible mechanism for the propulsion of Lysteria bacteria by means of actin 'comet tails'.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~tidema/research.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~tidema/research.html</a></p><p>–<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="file:///home/guillefix/Dropbox/Oxford/MMathPhys/topics%20in%20soft%20and%20active%20matter/ramin/prl05_motor.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Propulsion of a Molecular Machine by Asymmetric Distribution of Reaction Products</a>–</p><p><sub><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.220801" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Propulsion of a Molecular Machine by Asymmetric Distribution of Reaction Products (article)</a></sub></p><p>&quot;For a totally impermeable particle, depletion of the molecules near its surface causes a lateral slip velocity that results in net motion of the sphere. &quot;.
