<p>&lt;p&gt;Cool mechanics playing with &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Time&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; and mixing time and space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made some Matlab experiments of Mundo 4 (creo?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\*I think* the story is about a guy who had a girlfriend, but he was always seeking for more, for the perfect girlfriend (the &amp;quot;princess&amp;quot;). In the relationship, they learned to revert mistakes, as in going backwards in time. Therefore he couldn't really live with her for ever, as he was like an explorer. Sometimes time and space were mixed. And when he left her, to all of society it seemed like he was going backward, from warmth to destruction, but he was in fact going forward toward building the castle of his life...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very nice game, and puzzles, and story, and music&lt;/p&gt;</p>
