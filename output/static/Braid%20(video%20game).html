In the relationship, they learned to revert mistakes, as in going backwards in time. Therefore he couldn't really live with her for ever, as he was like an explorer. Sometimes time and space were mixed. And when he left her, to all of society it seemed like he was going backward, from warmth to destruction, but he was in fact going forward toward building the castle of his life...</p><p>Very nice game, and puzzles, and story, and music</p></div>
