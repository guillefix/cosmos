<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean&lt;/strong&gt; is a hierarchical agglomerative &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Clustering&quot;&gt;Clustering&lt;/a&gt; method, which means that one starts with the objects in separate clusters, and gradually merges these, depending on the distance between them, to form clusters. A distance cutoff has to be applied that determines when the program should stop forming clusters; i.e. once the distance between clusters is over a certain value, tehn no more merging should occur&lt;/p&gt;</p>
