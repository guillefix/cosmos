affected by the structure of the presynaptic spike train. Mathematically,
the only case for which the cross-correlation will be identical with the
synaptic transmission curve is that in which the firing times of the input
axon (a,) are not correlated to the firing times of all the other inputs that
affect a 2 and when the firing times of the input obey the statistics of a
uniform Poisson process (i.e., the probability of finding a spike is inde-
pendent of the time and of the past history of the axon). <mark>However, doesn't this depend on the output being a linear function of the input?</mark> Well no if we assume that the probability of two spikes being very close together (remember they are very thin in time) is very small, so we can ignore the non-linear effects of two synchronous spikes. (<mark>Linear regime</mark>)</p><p><sub>If the input spike train is non-Poissonian, but behaves as a
renewal process (i.e., the possibility of finding a spike depends only on
the time elapsed since the last spike [Cox, 1962]), then the true synaptic
transmission curve can be obtained by deconvolving the apparent re-
sponse curve from the autocorrelation curve of the input train [Perkel et
al., 1967].</sub></p><p>It is possible to evaluate the amount of correlation introduced
by the stimulus itself by computing the so-called <strong>shift-predictor correlogram</strong> [Perkel et al., 1967; Dickson and Gerstein, 1974]. &quot;joint

This covariation in firing rates of the two stimulated cells must be removed before considering the peak to be relevant (coming from a synaptic connectivity between them or common input). The easiest way to &quot;correct&quot; for this stimulus-induced relationship is to use the shift predictor.

mitted only between sets of cells with multiple diverging/converging
connections. We have shown that such connectivity exists and have de-
scribed some of the constraints on the size of the sets and the multiplicity
of the connections among them. We have suggested that a chain of such
connections can operate repeatedly if the activity along such a chain of
connections is transmitted by synchronous volleys of spikes (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Synfire%20chain">Synfire chain</a>)</p><p>Again, In Section 6.3 we saw that transmission through a diverging/converging
chain is not stable. It either decays to zero or amplifies itself until it
reaches saturation. Our contention, therefore, was that transmission
through such a chain was most likely to occur by synchronous volleys.
This form of transmission is examined in detail in Chapter 7.</p><h2 class=""><u>Synchronous transmission</u></h2><h3 class=""><u><strong>Synchronous gain</strong></u></h3><p>Definition 7.1.1: Synchronous gain 50 (<strong>SG50</strong>). The ratio between the
