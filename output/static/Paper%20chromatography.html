<p>&lt;p&gt;Chromatography can be used to separate mixtures of coloured compounds. Mixtures that are suitable for separation by chromatography include inks, dyes and colouring agents in food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple chromatography is carried out on paper. A spot of the mixture is placed near the bottom of a piece of chromatography paper. The paper is then placed upright in a suitable solvent, such as water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the solvent soaks up the paper, it carries the mixtures with it. Different components of the mixture will move at different rates. This separates the mixture out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/z2hcjxs/large&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Retardation value&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = distance moved by the compound รท distance moved by the solvent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value of a particular compound is always the same if the chromatography has been carried out in the same way. This allows industry to use chromatography to identify compounds in mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zmp4q6f/large&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
