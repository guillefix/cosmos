<p>Chromatography can be used to separate mixtures of coloured compounds. Mixtures that are suitable for separation by chromatography include inks, dyes and colouring agents in food.</p><p>Simple chromatography is carried out on paper. A spot of the mixture is placed near the bottom of a piece of chromatography paper. The paper is then placed upright in a suitable solvent, such as water.</p><p>As the solvent soaks up the paper, it carries the mixtures with it. Different components of the mixture will move at different rates. This separates the mixture out.</p><p><img src="http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/z2hcjxs/large"></p><h2 class=""><u>Retardation value</u></h2><p>R<sub>f</sub> = distance moved by the compound รท distance moved by the solvent.</p><p>The R<sub>f</sub> value of a particular compound is always the same if the chromatography has been carried out in the same way. This allows industry to use chromatography to identify compounds in mixtures.</p><p><img src="http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zmp4q6f/large"></p>
