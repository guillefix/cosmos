This can be deduced from considering the force balance at the bottom meniscus.</p><p>Also, I did the experiment comparing a dirtier glass surface with a cleaner one, and the degree of dirt correlated (by eye) both with the number and size of droplets that get stuck.</p><p>See also <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Dynamics%20of%20droplets">Dynamics of droplets</a></p>
