<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Enzyme%20inhibition">Enzyme inhibition</a></p><h2 class=""><u>Negative feedforward of feedback</u></h2><p>There  are  two  major  devices  for  achieving  negative  
feedforward  or  feedback.  One  way  is  to  prevent  the  relevant  enzymes  from  being  able  to  
perform-that  is,  to  &quot;clog  up&quot;  their  active  sites.  This  is  called  inhibition.  The  other  way  is  to  
prevent  the  relevant  enzymes  from  ever  being  manufactured!  This  is  called  repression.  
Conceptually, inhibition is simple: you just block up the active site of the first enzyme in the 
assembly line, and the whole process of synthesis gets stopped dead. </p><h2 class=""><u>Positive feedback and feedforward</u></h2><p>What about positive feedback and feedforward? Here again, there are two options: (1) 
unclog  the  clogged  enzymes (<strong>un-inhibit</strong>),  or  (2)  stop  the  repression  of  the  relevant  operon.  (Notice  how  
<b>nature  seems  to  love  double-negations! </b> Probably  there  is  some  very  deep  reason  for  this.)  </p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Gene%20expression%20regulation">Gene expression regulation</a> too
