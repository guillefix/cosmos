feedforward  or  feedback.  One  way  is  to  prevent  the  relevant  enzymes  from  being  able  to  
perform-that  is,  to  &amp;quot;clog  up&amp;quot;  their  active  sites.  This  is  called  inhibition.  The  other  way  is  to  
prevent  the  relevant  enzymes  from  ever  being  manufactured!  This  is  called  repression.  
Conceptually, inhibition is simple: you just block up the active site of the first enzyme in the 
assembly line, and the whole process of synthesis gets stopped dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Positive feedback and feedforward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about positive feedback and feedforward? Here again, there are two options: (1) 
unclog  the  clogged  enzymes (&lt;strong&gt;un-inhibit&lt;/strong&gt;),  or  (2)  stop  the  repression  of  the  relevant  operon.  (Notice  how  
&lt;b&gt;nature  seems  to  love  double-negations! &lt;/b&gt; Probably  there  is  some  very  deep  reason  for  this.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Gene%20expression%20regulation&quot;&gt;Gene expression regulation&lt;/a&gt; too
