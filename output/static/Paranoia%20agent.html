<p>&lt;p&gt;Somo...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticism of how we use &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Fantasy&quot;&gt;Fantasy&lt;/a&gt; to fall into &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Delusion&quot;&gt;Delusion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;escape reality&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can use fantasy/imagination for good, to explore reality, and seek truth, instead. This is the &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Chaos%20Magick&quot;&gt;Chaos Magick&lt;/a&gt; way. Malowi in the story appears as a master in this (and becomes the Ancient Master at the end)..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cool how Shatoshi Kon mixes reality and fantasy so seamlessly, touching on the meaning of &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Reality&quot;&gt;Reality&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Serial%20Experiments%20Lain&quot;&gt;Serial Experiments Lain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the girl confronts reality, taking reponsability of her actions. She emerges from the huge delusion, now represented as a huge dark goo/fog, which becomes the &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Sea&quot;&gt;Sea&lt;/a&gt; (the sea represents chaos, like in many old cosmogenic &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Myth&quot;&gt;Myth&lt;/a&gt;s). And she floats to the surface, as if becoming a new person, and I think making a reference to the very similar scene in &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Ghost%20in%20the%20shell&quot;&gt;Ghost in the shell&lt;/a&gt; (1995 movie).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cool weird intro with everyone laughing..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maromi is Shonnen Bato&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shonnen Bato turns out to be just any excuse we put to escape reality. It is the reassuring fable, which we use, instead of confronting the truth, which may be harsh/difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://the-artifice.com/satoshi-kon-otaku-anime/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://the-artifice.com/satoshi-kon-otaku-anime/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At times, the series resembles an anthology, with each episode throwing its star character through a Twist Ending â€” but everything later becomes connected in a way that rivals Serial Experiments Lain's levels of conspiracy and surrealism. &amp;quot; ( &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;
*Giving into lies and illusions to escape the hardships of reality might feel good in the short term, but it can't last. Everyone has problems, and shouldering them onto other people only makes more problems. Your troubles are yours to deal with; that's part of growing up.
*Japan's obsession with cuteness is getting in the way of actually doing things.
