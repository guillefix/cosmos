<p>Generally, <strong>percolation</strong> refers to qualitative changes in connectivity in systems (specially large ones) as its components are added or removed. In particular, percolation most often refers to the case where a system goes from being &quot;mostly disconnected&quot; to &quot;mostly connected&quot;, in some sense.
