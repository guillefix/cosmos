<p>Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Distillation">Distillation</a> to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Fractionation">fractionate</a>.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fractional_distillation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fractional_distillation</a></p><p>For many cases, the boiling points of the components in the mixture will be sufficiently close that Raoult's law must be taken into consideration. Therefore, fractional distillation must be used in order to separate the components by repeated vaporization-condensation cycles within a packed fractionating column. This separation, by successive distillations, is also referred to as rectification.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Distillation#/Fractional_distillation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Distillation#/Fractional_distillation</a></p><p>This is used to separate <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Crude%20oil">Crude oil</a> into useful liquids that have different boiling points.
