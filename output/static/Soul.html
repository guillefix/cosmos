<p>&lt;p&gt;A hypothetical supernatural quality of a &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Mind&quot;&gt;Mind&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Sentient%20being&quot;&gt;Sentient being&lt;/a&gt;. In other interpretations, it's synonymous with &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Mind&quot;&gt;Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHURCH-TURING THESIS, SOULISTS' VERS
ION: Some kinds of things which 
a  brain  can  do  can  be  vaguely  approxima
ted  on  a  computer  but  not  most,  and  
certainly not the interesting ones. But anyw
ay, even if they all could, that would 
still  leave  the  soul  to  explain,  and  there  is  no  way  that  computers  have  any  
bearing on that. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
