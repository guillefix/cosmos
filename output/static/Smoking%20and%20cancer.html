The biases considered are:<ul><li>Unrepresentativeness of sample, due to location, disease, or selection by interviewers. Statistics doesn't support this.</li><li>Exageration of smoking habits by carcinoma patients. Patients didn't know they had carcinoma and other respiratory diseases with similar symptoms same smoking as control.</li><li>Exaggeration by interviewers, who unfortunately could not be blinded of the disease of the patient.
