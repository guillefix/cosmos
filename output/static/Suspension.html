<p>A <strong>suspension</strong> is a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Dispersion%20(Chemistry)">dispersion</a> of solid particles in a liquid (IUPAC definition). For the particles to be definable as solid, they must have at least some size, and thus a suspension requires particles of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Colloid">colloidal</a> size, or larger.</p><p><sub>Some authors, use <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suspension</a> to refers to those suspensions where the particles are large enough to sediment. The case for smaller particles (like colloidal particles) may then be called <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_(colloid)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sol (colloid)</a>.</sub></p>
