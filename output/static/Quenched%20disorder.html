<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;note quenched disorder often refers to what we refer here as simply &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Disorder&quot;&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Disorder&quot;&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt; of a system in which the disordered variable is out of equilibrium. For instance in glasses. This can be achieved by cooling sufficiently rapidly, so that a random configuration is &lt;em&gt;quenched&lt;/em&gt;, and stays so, due to extremely large relaxation times.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
