<p><em>aka  SNP</em></p><p>A single-nucleotide polymorphism, often abbreviated to SNP (pronounced snip; plural snips), is a variation in a single nucleotide that occurs at a specific position in the genome, where each variation is present to some appreciable degree within a population (e.g. &gt; 1%)</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism</a></p><h2 class=""><u>SNP analysis</u></h2><p>SNPs are usually biallelic and thus easily assayed.[38] Analytical methods to discover novel SNPs and detect known SNPs include:</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Real-time%20PCR">Real-time PCR</a></li></ul><p>They are usually biallelic because mutations are rare, and so a single mutation in a population is much more likely than two.</p><h2 class=""><u>Computational analysis</u></h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Genomes">Genomes</a> with SNPs can be encoded by only looking at SNPs in each <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Haplotype">Haplotype</a>, encoded using a binary representation.</p>
