<p>There are many <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_model" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Epidemic model</a>.

These are mostly <em>compartmental models</em>, and their extensions are used to model mostly biological contagions (like infectious diseases), as well as some IT contagions (like computer viruses)</p><p>For <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Complex%20contagion">Complex contagion</a>s, nodes get infected by more complex processes, often involving several other nodes. These are often used to model more complicated social contagions and phenomena.
