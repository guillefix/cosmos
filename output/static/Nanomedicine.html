<h2 class=""><u>Nano-drugs delivery systems</u></h2><p>Only 3% of medicines often reach target. Particularly bad with cancer.. We need smart nanosystems. Problem with aggregiation. Use circular DNA wrapped around carbon nanotubes makes it stable in many solution media. Target only cancers with molecule added to DNA.  Add fluerescent moleucle for diagnostic. Then theragnostics, both therapeutics and dignosis on spot.</p><p>Can use the wrapping of DNA for other nanoparticles too!</p><p>Nanotoxicity and nanowaste are important problems too.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6070/831" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A Logic-Gated Nanorobot for Targeted Transport of Molecular Payloads</a></p><h2 class=""><u>Nano-sensors and diagnostics</u></h2><p>Detect causes of diseases before they are pathological.</p><h2 class=""><u>Nano-devices for medical surgery</u></h2><p>Nano-needle.
