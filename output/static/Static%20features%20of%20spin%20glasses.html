Because the spins interact, it was expected the system would have some sort of ordered phase at low temperatures. Indeed a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Phase%20transition">Phase transition</a> was observed, with a <strong>susceptibility cusp</strong> at a particular transition temperature <span><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T_f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.969438em;vertical-align:-0.286108em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="vlist"><span style="top:0.15em;margin-right:0.05em;margin-left:-0.13889em;"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">​</span></span><span class="reset-textstyle scriptstyle cramped"><span class="mord mathit" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span><span class="baseline-fix"><span class="fontsize-ensurer reset-size5 size5"><span style="font-size:0em;">​</span></span>​</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. The high temperature phase was a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Paramagnetism">paramagnetic</a> phase. Then experiments on the nature of the lower temperature phase were conducted.</p><p>There exists a variety of experimental probes that can provide information on what the atomic magnetic moments are doing, and measurements using these probes indicated several things.</p><ul><li>First, the <strong>spins were “frozen”</strong>; that is, unlike in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase, in which each spin flips and gyrates constantly so that its time-averaged magnetic moment is zero, at low temperatures each spin is more or less stuck in one orientation.</li><li>Second, the <strong>overall magnetization was zero</strong>, ruling out a ferromagnetic phase. But third, more sensitive probes indicated there was no long-range antiferromagnetic order either: in fact, as near as could be told, the spins seemed to be frozen in random orientations.</li></ul><p>However, the phase transition had some more surprises to reveal. Recall that at a phase transition, all the thermodynamic functions behave singularly in one fashion or another. Surely the <strong>specific heat</strong>, one of the simplest such functions, should show a singularity as well. However, when one measures the specific heat of a typical spin glass, one sees . . . absolutely nothing interesting at all. All you see is a <strong>broad, smooth, rounded maximum</strong>, which doesn’t even occur at the transition temperature (defined to be where the susceptibility peak occurs). A typical such measurement is shown in figure 4.2.</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/b7WYQmz.png"></p><p>So, returning to the topic at hand, we’re faced with the follow-
ing question: Is there a true thermodynamic phase transition to a
low-temperature spin glass phase characterized by a new kind of
magnetic ordering? Or is the spin glass just a kind of magnetic
analog to an ordinary structural glass, where there is no real
phase transition and the system simply falls out of equilibrium
because its intrinsic relaxational timescales exceed our human
observational timescales? If the latter, then the spins wouldn’t
really be frozen for eternity; they would just have slowed down
sufficiently that they appear frozen on any timescale that we can
imagine.</p><p>As of this writing, <span style="color:aqua; font-size:17px">the question remains open.</span></p>
