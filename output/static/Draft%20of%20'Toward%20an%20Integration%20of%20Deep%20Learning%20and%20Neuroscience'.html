A possible mechanism, by which biological neural networks could approximate backpropagation, is “feedback alignment” (Lillicrap et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2015). Other methods, using special network organizations have been proposed. See Hinton's talk. There are also <u>diverse mechanism</u> that go beyond conventional conceptions of backpropagation, like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Neuromodulation">Neuromodulation</a> by molecules.</p><p><strong>Temporal credit assignment</strong> is a difficult problem. Can generic recurrent networks perform temporal credit assignment in in a way that is more biologically plausible than &quot;backpropagation through time&quot; (BPTT)? Indeed, new discoveries are being made about the capacity for supervised learning in continuous-time recurrent networks with more realistic synapses and neural integration properties. BPTT can be achieved by learning to predict the backward-through-time gradient signal (costate) in a manner analogous to the prediction of value functions in reinforcement learning.</p><p>Fast connections maintain the network in a state where slow connections have local access to a global error signal.</p><p><sub>spiking recurrent networks using realistic population coding schemes can, with an appropriate choice of connection weights, compute complicated, cognitively relevant functions17.

[...] How could we hack together cost functions, built on simple genetically specifiable mechanisms, to make it easier for a learning system to discover such behaviorally relevant variables? Ullman refers to such primitive, inbuilt detectors as innate “proto-concepts” (Ullman et al., 2012). Their broader claim is that such pre-specification of mutual supervision signals can make learning the relevant features of the world far easier, by giving an otherwise unsupervised learner the right kinds of hints or heuristic biases at the right times. Here we call these approximate, heuristic cost functions “bootstrap cost functions.” The purpose of the bootstrap cost functions is to reduce the amount of data required to learn a specific feature or task, but at the same time to avoid a need for fully unsupervised learning.</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Hand">Hand</a>s</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Face">Face</a>s</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Emotion">Emotion</a>s</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Agency">Agency</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Ethics">Ethics</a></li></ul><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Evolution">Evolution</a>:  it seems likely that the brain would make extensive use of them to ensure that developing animals learn the precise patterns of perception and behavior needed to ensure their later survival and reproduction.</p><p><u>Cost Functions for Learning by Imitation and through Social Feedback</u>. Babies and children learn about cause and effect through models based on goals, outcomes and agents, not just pure statistical inference.</p><p>cost functions and optimization are not the whole story. To achieve more complex forms of optimization, e.g., for learning to understand complex patterns of cause and effect over long timescales, to plan and reason prospectively, or to effectively coordinate many widely distributed brain resources, the brain seems to invoke specialized, pre-constructed data structures, algorithms and communication systems, which in turn facilitate specific kinds of optimization. Moreover, optimization occurs in a tightly orchestrated multi-stage process, and specialized, pre-structured brain systems need to be invoked to account for this meta-level of control over when, where and how each optimization problem is set up. </p><p><u>Cost Functions for Story Generation and Understanding</u></p><h2 class=""><u>Optimization Occurs in the Context of Specialized Structures</u></h2><p>pre-structured architectures are needed to allow the brain to find efficient solutions to certain types of problems. the brain may need pre-specialized systems for planning and executing sequential multi-step processes, for accessing memories, and for forming and manipulating compositional and recursive structures</p><p>Second, the training of optimization modules may need to be coordinated in a complex and dynamic fashion, including delivering the right training signals and activating the right learning rules in the right places and at the right times.

These structures evolutionarily pre-date (Lee et al., 2015) the cortex, and hence the cortex may have evolved to work in the context of such specialized mechanisms. For example, the cortex may have evolved as a trainable module for which the training is orchestrated by these older structures.</p>
