In physics and engineering, a <strong>constitutive equation</strong> or <strong>constitutive relation</strong> is a relation between two physical quantities (especially kinetic quantities as related to kinematic quantities) that is specific to a material or substance, and approximates the response of that material to external stimuli, usually as applied fields or forces.</p><p>They are often just <u>phenomenological</u>, because bulk material, or a sufficiently large amount of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Condensed%20matter%20physics">condensed matter</a>, is a very complex system, made of many interacting particles.
