During mitosis and
meiosis the chromosome condense into supercoiled chromatids attached into pairs at the centromere. While during normal
cellular growth, known as interphase, the chromosomes need to unfold in order for the DNA to be either replicated or for gene
transcription to occur. The total size of the human genome is approximately 3 thousands Mega-basepairs (3 billion BPs),
which needs to be contained inside the cells nucleus, only ~10 micron (0.01mm) in diameter. The DNA is wrapped around
nucleosomes consisting of an octamer of histone proteins which can be up to 80bp appart. The linker DNA between histones
contains cis-regulatory elements. They are non-coding DNA sequences such as core and proximal promoter regions,
enhancers, silencers and other type of sites that can bind transcription factors and activators, and thus, regulate gene
expression. ~ Nikolai Drouzine</p>
