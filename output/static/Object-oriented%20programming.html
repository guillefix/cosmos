<p>a.k.a. OOP</p><p><strong>object</strong> = collection of data and functions (methods), that often act on this data.</p><p>Keywords: Encapsulation. Message-passing metaphor. data abstraction. Modularity.</p><p>Abstract data types (often implemented as classes). A <strong>class</strong> is a collection of objects with characteristics in common. A class is represented as a template from which one can instantiate objects. Instantiation is often done by &quot;calling&quot; the class, as if it were a function.</p><p>In many respects, classes and objects are similar.</p><table><tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td><u>Data hiding</u>: One can only access instance values through defined methods. Sometimes built in language, but even if not, it is often good practice.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>An object built from a class, is an <u>instance</u>, and it has <u>attributes</u>: methods and fields (variables). These are often called using <code>.</code> notation.</p><p><em>Methods in Python</em></p><ul><li>_ _init_ _: create instance</li><li>_ _str_ _: printed representation</li><li>_ _cmp_ _: comparisons (returns -1, 0, 1).</li><li>_ _iter_ _ and <code>next</code> to define how iteration happens over an object that represents a collection.</li></ul><p>These are doing operator overloading. In Python, <code>dir(p)</code> shows all methods associated with an object. </p><p><code>type(</code>instance<code>)</code> returns the class.</p><p><u>Inheritance</u></p><p>A class can inherit attributes from another class, when its defined.</p><p><u>Shadowing</u> (a.k.a. overriding an inherited method).</p><p>OOP is good for modelling systems where you have lots of elements that possibly interact.</p><hr><p><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImwrezYhw4w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Factory functions in JavaScript</a></u></p><p>Factories are functions that implement the same functions as classes, but have some advantages. The only disadvantage is that they are a bit slower probably.</p><p>I think this is related to <em>prototype-oriented programming</em>, JavaScript's version of OOP.</p>
