<p>&lt;p&gt;Manners are a set of customs used to restrict our behaviour so as to make others feel more comfortable, expecting they will also do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Spain, at least, this is called &lt;em&gt;educacion&lt;/em&gt; / politeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCTzbc76WXY&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French queen Eleanor of Aquitaine initiates the cultural meme (known as cavalry) that sets the manners of men around women: showing them respect, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://revistabulevard.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mind-your-manners.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The invention of a certain kind of delicate glassware in Italy also meant an expression that controlling our force was seen as noble/civilized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Russeau&lt;/a&gt; challenged our view of manners as something which good/the basis of our civilization. His extreme concept of the &lt;em&gt;noble savage&lt;/em&gt; proclaimed the opposite: that being relaxed, unrestrained is how we feel better/happier. His views still resonate in modern times, and have helped reach a balance between the high class of XVIII century France, and the totally wild behaviour of our prehistoric ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America was an early hotbed for the evolution of modern manners, as it was a new country.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
