<p><em>aka nonlinear dimensionality reduction</em></p><p>nonlinear dimensionality reduction consist of two steps: first, they start with con - structing a representation of local affinity of the data points (typically, a sparsely connected graph). Second, the data points are embedded into a low-dimensional space, trying to preserve some criterion of the original affinity. For example, spectral embeddings tend to map points with many connec- tions between them to nearby locations, and multidimension- al scaling (MDS)-type methods try to preserve global information, such as graph geodesic distances. Examples of manifold learning include different flavors of MDS [26] , locally linear embedding [27] , sto- chastic neighbor embedding [28 ], spectral embeddings, such as Laplacian eigenmaps [29] and diffusion maps [30] , and deep models [31] . Instead of embedding the vertices, the graph structure can be pro - cessed by decomposing it into small subgraphs called motifs [36] or graphlets [37]. Finally, most recent approaches [32]– [34] tried to apply the successful word-embedding model [35] to graphs.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFxypsvhhMQ#=44m" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Input distribution lies in a manifold when there is structure/correlations in high dimensional space</a> – like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Sloppy%20model">Sloppy model</a>s</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction#Laplacian_eigenmaps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction#Laplacian_eigenmaps</a></p><p>Several efficient manifold learning techniques have been proposed.</p><ul><li><strong>Isometric feature mapping</strong> (ISOMAP) (Balasubramanian et al., 2002) estimates the geodesic distances on the manifold and uses them for projection. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Multidimensional%20scaling">Multidimensional scaling</a> with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Geodesic">Geodesic</a> distance, basically. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5500/2319?ijkey=4459d99d55dbcf7cf47149bee86b1e483a2b4437&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A Global Geometric Framework for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction</a> – <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5552/7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Isomap Algorithm and Topological Stability</a></li><li>Locality Preserving Projections (LPP)</li><li><strong>Locally linear embedding</strong> (LLE) (Roweis and Saul, 2000) projects data points to a low-dimensional space that preserves local geometric properties. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/lectures/ml/lle.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a></li><li>Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) (Belkin and Niyogi, 2003) uses the weighted distance between two points as the loss function to get the dimension reduction results.</li><li>Local tangent space alignment (LTSA) (Zhang and Zha, 2004) constructs a local tangent space for each point and obtains the global low-dimensional embedding results through affine transformation of the local tangent spaces.</li></ul><p>Yan et al.
