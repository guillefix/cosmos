A large molecule will disrupt this configuration, and will effectively reduce the entropy of the system. Therefore, there will be an effective force (entropic force) pushing large molecules together so that this disruption is the least, and so entropy is maximized, as it will in equilibrium. This is the hydrophobic interaction. <u>Question</u>: doesn't the fact that large non-polar molecules attract via van der Waals only while water (polar) attracts via Hydrogen bonding, but barely via van der Waals, and therefore these two different kinds of molecule barely attract, not also play a role in they wanting to clump together with like kinds, but separately from unlike kind?</p><p>Compounds that experience hydrophobic interactions are known as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Hydrophobic">Hydrophobic</a></p>
