This fact indicates that, <b>even in adaptive evolution, the majority of point mutations is neutral</b>. This is the basis of <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kimura's neutral theory of evolution</a>, see <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic887718.files/kimura.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the paper</a>.</p><p>A <strong>neutral network</strong> is a collection of mutually neutral genotypes (i.e. producing the same phenotype, whether structure or function), which are connected via single mutational steps; they sometimes form extended networks that permeate large regions of genotype space. A population is <strong>mutationally robust</strong> (insensitive against mutations) when it inhabits a highly interconnected region of the network so that most mutations lead to the same neutral network, thus leaving the phenotype unchanged.</p><p>In <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/96/17/9716.full.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neutral evolution of mutational robustness</a>, the authors found analytically, that for a range of population sizes and mutation rates of biological interest, <b>the population's distribution over a neutral network is determined solely by the network's topology</b>.</p>
