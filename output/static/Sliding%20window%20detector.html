<p>One approach to this problem
is to divide the image into many small overlapping patches at different locations, scales and
orientations, and to classify each such patch based on whether it contains face-like texture or
not. This is called a sliding window detector. The system then returns those locations where
the probability of face is sufficiently high.</p>
