<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural balance&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the situation when a &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Signed%20network&quot;&gt;Signed network&lt;/a&gt; contains only loops with even numbers of minus signs. This is so that the (naturally generalized version of the) rule &amp;quot;the enemies of my enemies are my friends&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;the friends of my friends are my friends&amp;quot;. The opposite situation is called &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Frustration&quot;&gt;Frustration&lt;/a&gt; in spin networks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harary's theorem&lt;/strong&gt; tells us that all balanced networks are &lt;em&gt;clusterable&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. they can be divided into groups with only positive connections within groups and negative between them. Proof given in Newman's book and gives further intuition of concept of balance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
