<p><strong>Structural balance</strong> refers to the situation when a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Signed%20network">Signed network</a> contains only loops with even numbers of minus signs. This is so that the (naturally generalized version of the) rule &quot;the enemies of my enemies are my friends&quot;, and &quot;the friends of my friends are my friends&quot;. The opposite situation is called <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Frustration">Frustration</a> in spin networks</p><p><strong>Harary's theorem</strong> tells us that all balanced networks are <em>clusterable</em>, i.e. they can be divided into groups with only positive connections within groups and negative between them. Proof given in Newman's book and gives further intuition of concept of balance.</p>
