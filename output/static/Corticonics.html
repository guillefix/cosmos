<p>The study of the foundamtental computations that are applied through out the cortex</p><p>Classification of cortical areas according to structural and functional differences cannot in itself bring about an understanding of the common operations con-ducted by the cortex and the manner in which they are carried out. Corticonics is the study of these common processes and their underlying neural mechanisms. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375010/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phase organization of network computations</a></p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Cortex">Cortex</a></p><h2 class=""><u>Models</u></h2><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Neuronal%20network">Neuronal network</a></p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Hopfield%20network">Hopfield network</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Spiking%20neural%20network">Spiking neural network</a>s</li></ul>
