thermodynamic quantities and their geometric counterparts based on the statistical and fractal properties of FK clusters.</sub></p><p>This allowed powerful renormalization group ideas to be used [74]. </p><p>Swendsen and Wang [105], and then Wolff [106], have exploited this mapping to devise extraordinar- ily efficient Monte Carlo algorithms.</p><p>There are mappings between the Ising model at a given dimension and a model of manifolds surrounding the geometric spin clusters.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01014303" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Percolation and the Potts model</a>.
