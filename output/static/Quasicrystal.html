When inspecting various samples of a rapidly solidified Al Mn alloy with an electron microscope in diffraction mode, he noticed a phase that showed clear and sharp Bragg reflexes to- gether with a rather perfect icosahedral symmetry, similar to the one shown in Figure 1.1. While a Bragg spectrum is a typical fingerprint of a crystal, fivefold or icosahedral symmetry is incompatible with the latter. He con- cluded that this phase must possess long-range order (to explain the Bragg reflexes) without being a perfect crystal (to be able to accommodate the un- usual symmetry). It took Shechtman two years to convince colleagues until the result was finally published in <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.53.1951" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Metallic Phase with Long-Range Orientational Order and No Translational Symmetry</a>. Even after the paper appeared in print, prominent scientists (including Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling) ex- pressed their scepticism, though they found themselves in a rapidly shrinking minority as other phases with similar properties were discovered.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-2476-2_6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-2476-2_6</a></p>
