<p>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;component&lt;/em&gt; is a subset of the network for which all pair of vertices have at least one path, and which is maximal (i.e no extra nodes can be added that preserve this property). A connected graph has only one component, while a disconnected one has more than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjacency matrix can always be written in block diagonal form with blocks corresponding to components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Components in directed networks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weakly connected components&lt;/em&gt; are components of a directed network ignoring the direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strongly connected components&lt;/em&gt; have a path between any two vertices &lt;em&gt;in both directions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acyclical graphs can't have  strongly connected components with &amp;gt;1 vertex since, they would necessarily include a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Out-components&lt;/em&gt; are all the vertices reachable from a certain vertex, including the vertex itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-components&lt;/em&gt; are all the vertices from which one can reach a certain vertex, including the vertex itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these are  identical for all vertices in a strongly connected component.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
