<p><em><sub>why spend so much effort acquiring all the data when we know that most of it will be discarded?</sub></em></p><p><strong>Compressed sensing</strong> (also known as <strong>compressive sensing</strong>, <strong>compressive sampling</strong>, or <strong>sparse sampling</strong>) is a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Signal%20processing">Signal processing</a> technique for efficiently acquiring and reconstructing a signal, by finding solutions to underdetermined <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Linear%20system">Linear system</a>s.
