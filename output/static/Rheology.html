<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rheology</a> is a branch of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Continuum%20mechanics">Continuum mechanics</a> that <u>studies the flow of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Bulk%20matter">matter</a></u>, primarily in a liquid state, but also as 'soft solids' or solids under conditions in which they respond with plastic flow rather than deforming elastically in response to an applied force. That is, rheology does not study a particular class of matter, but the flow of any matter.</p>
