What inequality says is:
If sup acts first and then inf, we get smaller or equal value than if inf acts first and then sup
basically whoever acts last sup or inf wins (whoever laughs last laughs the best)
this is because after sup act, and then inf acts, what we get is a lower bound on how good sup could act no matter what inf did. No matter what inf does, doing what sup does in the first case gives a value at least as big as sup inf, so that what sup can do after inf (inf sup) is at least that&lt;/p&gt;</p>
