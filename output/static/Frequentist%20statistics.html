<p>See comments and thoughts in my notebook (also on Telegram) </p><p>I don't know if this is common knowledge or not, but I just realized that frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing (in some simple cases at least*) are equivalent under mapping the prior probability of the alternative hypothesis to the frequentist significance level.</p><ul><li>I am thinking about two discrete hypotheses, and two possible values of the data for now, and with some mild assumptions/approximations</li></ul><p>It's intuitive really. You accept a null hypothesis rejection with p=5% unless you think the alternative had a less than 5% chance of being true. I.e. you find the alternative less likely than chance, given than chance had a probability of p=5%</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2272/whats-the-difference-between-a-confidence-interval-and-a-credible-interval" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2272/whats-the-difference-between-a-confidence-interval-and-a-credible-interval</a></p>
