(IUPAC)</p><p>A colloidal dispersion is a system in which particles of colloidal size of any nature (e.g. solid, liquid or gas) are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Dispersion%20(Chemistry)">dispersed</a> in a continuous phase of a different composition (or state). The &quot;name dispersed&quot; phase for the particles should be used only if they have essentially the properties of a bulk phase of the same composition.</p><p>(<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01174.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01174.html</a>)</p><h2 class=""><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Colloid%20physics">Colloid physics</a></u></h2><p>Branch of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Physics">Physics</a> dealing with physical properties of colloidal systems (i.e. motion, forces, etc. at the scale of the colloidal system).</p><p>See book by Hunter - Foundations of colloid science
