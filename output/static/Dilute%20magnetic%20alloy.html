<p>These
are materials in which a very small concentration (at most a
few percent) of a magnetic element, often iron or manganese,
is substituted at random locations inside a nonmagnetic metallic
host, such as one of the noble metals (copper, silver, or gold).</p><p>At low densities of the magnetic atoms, their resistance, which in
normal metals decreases and eventually flattens as the temperature
is lowered, starts to rise again at a few degrees above absolute zero.
This came to be known as the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Kondo%20effect">Kondo effect</a>.</p><p>At higher concentrations (already at about 1%), the impurities in dilute magnetic alloys begin interacting, and they were among the first examples of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Spin%20glass">Spin glass</a>es.</p>
