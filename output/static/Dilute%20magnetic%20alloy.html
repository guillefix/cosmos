<p>&lt;p&gt;These
are materials in which a very small concentration (at most a
few percent) of a magnetic element, often iron or manganese,
is substituted at random locations inside a nonmagnetic metallic
host, such as one of the noble metals (copper, silver, or gold).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At low densities of the magnetic atoms, their resistance, which in
normal metals decreases and eventually flattens as the temperature
is lowered, starts to rise again at a few degrees above absolute zero.
This came to be known as the &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Kondo%20effect&quot;&gt;Kondo effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At higher concentrations (already at about 1%), the impurities in dilute magnetic alloys begin interacting, and they were among the first examples of &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Spin%20glass&quot;&gt;Spin glass&lt;/a&gt;es.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
