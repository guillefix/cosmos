<p>&lt;p&gt;A subdivision of a simplicial complex K is a simplicial complex K' together with a homeomorphism h: |K' | → |K| such that, for any simplex σ' of K' , h(σ') lies entirely in a simplex of |K| and the restriction of h to σ' is &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Affine%20extension&quot;&gt;affine&lt;/a&gt; (linear, but restricted to the simplex)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
