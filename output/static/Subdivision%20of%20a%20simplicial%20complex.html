<p>A subdivision of a simplicial complex K is a simplicial complex K' together with a homeomorphism h: |K' | → |K| such that, for any simplex σ' of K' , h(σ') lies entirely in a simplex of |K| and the restriction of h to σ' is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Affine%20extension">affine</a> (linear, but restricted to the simplex)</p>
