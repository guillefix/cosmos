This has been done, for example, in the Linux kernel.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translate to life:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always leave some time for different things. Don't let any particular aspect take so much time as to not allow you to enjoy other things. Aka the &amp;quot;work-live balance&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You shouldn't let unimportant things hold up important ones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't overthink so much about optimizing what to do, that you don't end up doing anything. Aka (by me) the Metawork fallacy/trap&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers to &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Meaning%20of%20life&quot;&gt;a happy and fulfilling life&lt;/a&gt; were lying there in front of me, all this time, lurking in the code behind the screen.
