Due to the noisy nature of these input signals, path integration processes tend to accumulate errors as animals explore the environment, leading to a loss of grid-like activity. It has been suggested that border-to-grid cells' associations minimize the accumulated grid cells' error when rodents explore enclosures. Thus, the border-grid interaction for error minimization is a suitable scenario to study the effects of border cell scaling within the context of spatial representation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5513924/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Size Matters: How Scaling Affects the Interaction between Grid and Border Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
