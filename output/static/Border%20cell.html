Due to the noisy nature of these input signals, path integration processes tend to accumulate errors as animals explore the environment, leading to a loss of grid-like activity. It has been suggested that border-to-grid cells' associations minimize the accumulated grid cells' error when rodents explore enclosures. Thus, the border-grid interaction for error minimization is a suitable scenario to study the effects of border cell scaling within the context of spatial representation. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5513924/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Size Matters: How Scaling Affects the Interaction between Grid and Border Cells</a></p>
