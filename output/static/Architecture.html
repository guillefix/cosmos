Much like the current story of the Internet killing the printed book. The analogies in the story should give you new eyes with which to look at buildings, and to books, and to human thought and creation.</p><p>With VR, the hurdles that caused architecture to die under the weight of the printing press, are no more. Thus why architecture is reviving, in a new virtual medium, that I doubt Victor Hugo could have imagined. The Metaverse is the ground of new Gothic freedom.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j5JQHk89_WAC&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j5JQHk89_WAC&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs57jh7kHcI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The next era in architecture</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tracery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tracery</a></p>
