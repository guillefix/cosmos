Graphite, for example, has a melting point of more than 3,600°C.</li><li>Variable electrical conductivity - diamond does not conduct electricity, whereas graphite contains free electrons so it does conduct electricity. Silicon is a semi-conductor – it is midway between non-conductive and conductive.</li></ul>
