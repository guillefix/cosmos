I know that from the past, and Im
happy with that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I really liked the soundtrack, and I do think the movie
is visually interesting. Just one of many examples: there is a transition
from a scene with a fireplace where the levitating embers blend into
city lights. The whole cyberpunk vibe is very well achieved in many
cityscape scenes too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the plot things you mentioned.. The way l see movies, I
think you are asking too many questions.. Or rather, the wrong kinds of questions. I like to see movies, not as something that was created by someone to impress me. I like to see movies as if they really happened. I like to get in their world, and forget the real world. Plot holes sometimes appear, but I take it as: &amp;quot;Oh, this is weird, why is this happening?&amp;quot;, and then I start some internal world-specific scientific process, where I try to look for within-world explanations, and stuff. The people who made the film are the last people who I think of while watching it. In this way, you don't think about &amp;quot;Why did they chcose A over B, or C over D&amp;quot;, but instead you wonder about &amp;quot;how did the world end up in this state? why does this guy have a holographic girl? Is he lonely? Is that part of society? Is it because of the power of Wallace industries?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Why does this guy have so much power?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Why are people so immoral with respect to replicants?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Is the media taking a role?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Are all this sexually-protrayed girl ads, just part of a media system trying to numb people by letting them escape from their real dystopian situation?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Is the whole aesthetic of a futuristic/cyberpunk world helping making people forget the problems with their society, by indulging in hedonistic enjoyment?&amp;quot; 
I actually thought the plot was interesting too. The conflict between keeping order, versus showing society the harsh truth that they are killing real humans, versus the crazy dreams of a crazy visionary. The question of real vs fake memories, of trying to find who one really is, in a world where an &amp;quot;information blackout&amp;quot; and memory-creation, makes the past seem like it didn't exist. The contrast with the casino in the radiation zone, being frozen in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Btw, the sculptures and aesthetic from the radiation zone I think are probably inspired by Burning Man, as they have quite similar things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the other type of questions, I can't help myself to ask: &amp;quot;how is all this technology possible?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What is making the cars fly?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How does the holograms work?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How can that little device project it/and sense the external world so effectively?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;some advance image processing? or are there more external sensors not being shown?...&amp;quot; &amp;quot;why are replicants so obedient?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;what are these psychological test? Is it similar to Asimov's robopsychology?&amp;quot;....&lt;/p&gt;</p>
