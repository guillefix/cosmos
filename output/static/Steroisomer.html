<p>A <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Molecule">Molecule</a> that has the same <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Chemical%20formula">Chemical formula</a> as another molecule, but differs in the orientation of its atoms in space. This can happen by swapping some <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Moiety">Moiety</a>es by their mirror images</p><p>If the molecule is just the mirror image of the other molecule, it is called an <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Enantiomer">Enantiomer</a>, and if it isn't, it is a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Diasteromer">Diasteromer</a>s. If two steroisomers are actually the same (can be made to coincide after a rotation) they are known as <strong>meso compound
