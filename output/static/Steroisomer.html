<p>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Molecule&quot;&gt;Molecule&lt;/a&gt; that has the same &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Chemical%20formula&quot;&gt;Chemical formula&lt;/a&gt; as another molecule, but differs in the orientation of its atoms in space. This can happen by swapping some &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Moiety&quot;&gt;Moiety&lt;/a&gt;es by their mirror images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the molecule is just the mirror image of the other molecule, it is called an &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Enantiomer&quot;&gt;Enantiomer&lt;/a&gt;, and if it isn't, it is a &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Diasteromer&quot;&gt;Diasteromer&lt;/a&gt;s. If two steroisomers are actually the same (can be made to coincide after a rotation) they are known as &lt;strong&gt;meso compound

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
