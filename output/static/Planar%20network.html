<p>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;planar network&lt;/strong&gt; (or graph) is one that can be drawn on a plane without having any edges cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these graphs we can define the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Dual%20Graph&quot;&gt;Dual Graph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, with vertices being &lt;em&gt;faces&lt;/em&gt; (regions completely enclosed by edges), and edges being among &lt;em&gt;faces&lt;/em&gt; that share an edge of the original graph. This new graph is also planar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual graphs were used to prove the &lt;strong&gt;four-color theorem&lt;/strong&gt; by Appel and Haken, which translated to graphs is stated in terms of the &lt;strong&gt;chromatic number&lt;/strong&gt;, the number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph in such a way that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kuratowski's theorem&lt;/u&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of yet, there is no popular measure of degree of planarity (i.e. &lt;em&gt;how planar&lt;/em&gt; a graph is?)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
