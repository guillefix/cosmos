<p>A <strong>planar network</strong> (or graph) is one that can be drawn on a plane without having any edges cross.</p><p>For these graphs we can define the <strong><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Dual%20Graph">Dual Graph</a></strong>, with vertices being <em>faces</em> (regions completely enclosed by edges), and edges being among <em>faces</em> that share an edge of the original graph. This new graph is also planar</p><p>Dual graphs were used to prove the <strong>four-color theorem</strong> by Appel and Haken, which translated to graphs is stated in terms of the <strong>chromatic number</strong>, the number of colors required to color the vertices of a graph in such a way that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.</p><p><u>Kuratowski's theorem</u>...</p><p>As of yet, there is no popular measure of degree of planarity (i.e. <em>how planar</em> a graph is?)</p>
