<p>Strictly speaking, a <strong>quantum liquid</strong> is a spatially homogeneous system of strongly interacting particles at temperatures sufficiently low that the effects of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Quantum%20statistical%20physics">quantum statistics</a> are important.</p><p>In practice the term is used more broadly, to include those aspects of the behavoir of conduction electrons in metals and degenerate semiconductors which are not sensitive to the periodic nature of the ionic potential.</p><p>See also <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quantum fluid</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_spin_liquid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quantum spin liquid</a></p>
