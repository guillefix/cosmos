<p>&lt;p&gt;In this formulation (frequentists), a 95% confidence interfval means that 95% of the times we draw a sample of this type, 95% of the time this confidence interval will include the mean. 95% probability that our interval contains the real mean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find p_est such that P(e&amp;lt;e_observed) is 0.05. That way, even if p is that high, p will fall within the confidence interval with 95% probability. For confidence intervals, imagine p fixed, and possible e_obs. Then find procedure, (like a fixed interval size, in the simplest case), so that p will fall in the interval with probability alpha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QAz45x3maDrs7uVACsJb-wVre_M8GW1hKpjEworLcbI/edit&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QAz45x3maDrs7uVACsJb-wVre_M8GW1hKpjEworLcbI/edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
