<p>In this formulation (frequentists), a 95% confidence interfval means that 95% of the times we draw a sample of this type, 95% of the time this confidence interval will include the mean. 95% probability that our interval contains the real mean</p><hr><p>Find p_est such that P(e&lt;e_observed) is 0.05. That way, even if p is that high, p will fall within the confidence interval with 95% probability. For confidence intervals, imagine p fixed, and possible e_obs. Then find procedure, (like a fixed interval size, in the simplest case), so that p will fall in the interval with probability alpha</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QAz45x3maDrs7uVACsJb-wVre_M8GW1hKpjEworLcbI/edit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QAz45x3maDrs7uVACsJb-wVre_M8GW1hKpjEworLcbI/edit</a></p>
