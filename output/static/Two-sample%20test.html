In bioinformatics,  it is of interest to compare microarraydata from identical tissue types as measured by different laboratories, todetect whether the datamay be analysed jointly, or whether differences in experimental procedure have caused systematicdifferences in the data distributions.  Equally of interest are comparisons between microarray datafrom different tissue types, either to determine whether two subtypes of cancer may be treated asstatistically indistinguishable from a diagnosis perspective, or to detect differences in healthy andcancerous tissue. In database attribute matching, it is desirable to merge databases containing mul-tiple fields, where it is not known in advance which fields correspond:  thefields are matched bymaximising the similarity in the distributions of their entries.</p>
