For instance, in OpenGL/WebGL, your vertices can be transformed to what is called <strong>clipspace</strong>, using <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Homogeneous%20coordinates">Homogeneous coordinates</a>, which are then automatically processed to project them as 2d points in the device screen. The 2d pixel coordinates corresponding to the vertices, as well as to all points inside the polygon primitives (often triangles) that go with those vertices, are often passed to the fragment shader, to decide which color they should appear as.</li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Fragment%20shader">Fragment shader</a></li></ul><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-shaders-and-glsl.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WebGL shaders and GLSL</a></p>
