<p>&lt;p&gt;I had this idea! Well, I think there's still more work to do on artificial parietal cortices: neural networks for somato-sensory integration, i.e. combining the info from many different senses. I myself think that our semantic latent space in our minds is somewhere in the parietal lobe..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An architecture based on these ideas is what I hope could make a NN that can begin to generate realistic stories, which I think is a crucial part for AI. Things to include: has to be recurrent, multi-sensory integration into and from semantic latent space, attention. The training may be adversarial, though I think it may need to have some more advanced type of multi-modal context-dependent training (attention in training?). Also, metalearning/introspection (which I think in the brain resides in the frontal lobe) will be crucial. Finally, more advanced memory, like DNCs, will be necessary at some point (in the brain, hippocampus), but I don't yet know well how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6nYgeH8Krs&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unsupervised Learning of Spoken Language with Visual Context&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/publications/2016/FelixSun_SLT_2016.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/publications/2016/FelixSun_SLT_2016.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See facebook posts.
