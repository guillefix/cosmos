<p>&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Simple%20contagion&quot;&gt;Simple contagion&lt;/a&gt;s, a node can get infected by simple exposure to another infected node (possibly with a certain probability or rate). These are mostly &lt;em&gt;compartmental models&lt;/em&gt;, and their extensions are used to model mostly biological contagions (like infectious diseases), as well as some IT contagions (like computer viruses)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Complex%20contagion&quot;&gt;Complex contagion&lt;/a&gt;s, nodes get infected by more complex processes, often involving several other nodes. These are often used to model more complicated social contagions and phenomena.
