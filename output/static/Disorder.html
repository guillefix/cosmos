<p><sub><em>Sometimes disorder is used as a synonym of randomness, in which case, what I describe here is called quenched disorder</em>.</sub></p><p><em>Disorder</em>, I think, refers to a particular kind of randomness in a system, in which there may be spatial randomness, but the random variables are fixed, for each instance of the system. This is in contrast to spatio-temporal disorder due to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Temperature">Temperature</a>, as described by <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Statistical%20physics">Statistical physics</a>. </p><p>As means of illustration, if the disorder is in a parameter in the Hamiltonian, for instance in some couplings (as in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Spin%20glass">Spin glass</a>es), it means that, before analyzing the Hamiltonian, we first determine all the couplings by coin tossing, or what-ever other method we choose; after that, they remain fixed for all time. This process leads to a particular choice, or realization, of the couplings, and thus a particular realization of the Hamiltonian, or the system.</p><p>Disorder affects the behaviour if the system is finite, or if the disorder is non-<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Self-averaging">Self-averaging</a>. A system that has disorder, specially if the disorder affects its behaviour, is referred to as a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Disordered%20system">Disordered system</a>.</p><p><u>Types of disorder</u></p><p>There are two types of disorder:</p><ul><li><b><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Annealed%20disorder">Annealed disorder</a></b>: disorder of a system at thermal equilibrium. This can be physically achieved by cooling the system down sufficiently slowly so that the system is in quasi-equilibrium at all times.</li><li><b><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Quenched%20disorder">Quenched disorder</a></b>: disorder of a system in which the disordered variable is out of equilibrium. For instance in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Glass">Glass</a>es. This can be achieved by cooling sufficiently rapidly, so that a random configuration is <em>quenched</em>, and stays so, due to extremely large relaxation times.</li><li>One could also have a combination of the two.</li></ul>
