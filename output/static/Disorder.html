<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes disorder is used as a synonym of randomness, in which case, what I describe here is called quenched disorder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disorder&lt;/em&gt;, I think, refers to a particular kind of randomness in a system, in which there may be spatial randomness, but the random variables are fixed, for each instance of the system. This is in contrast to spatio-temporal disorder due to &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Temperature&quot;&gt;Temperature&lt;/a&gt;, as described by &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Statistical%20physics&quot;&gt;Statistical physics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As means of illustration, if the disorder is in a parameter in the Hamiltonian, for instance in some couplings (as in &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Spin%20glass&quot;&gt;Spin glass&lt;/a&gt;es), it means that, before analyzing the Hamiltonian, we first determine all the couplings by coin tossing, or what-ever other method we choose; after that, they remain fixed for all time. This process leads to a particular choice, or realization, of the couplings, and thus a particular realization of the Hamiltonian, or the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disorder affects the behaviour if the system is finite, or if the disorder is non-&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Self-averaging&quot;&gt;Self-averaging&lt;/a&gt;. A system that has disorder, specially if the disorder affects its behaviour, is referred to as a &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Disordered%20system&quot;&gt;Disordered system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Types of disorder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of disorder:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Annealed%20disorder&quot;&gt;Annealed disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: disorder of a system at thermal equilibrium. This can be physically achieved by cooling the system down sufficiently slowly so that the system is in quasi-equilibrium at all times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Quenched%20disorder&quot;&gt;Quenched disorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: disorder of a system in which the disordered variable is out of equilibrium. For instance in &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Glass&quot;&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt;es. This can be achieved by cooling sufficiently rapidly, so that a random configuration is &lt;em&gt;quenched&lt;/em&gt;, and stays so, due to extremely large relaxation times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One could also have a combination of the two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
