These particles are crowded, or jammed together like grains of sand on a beach, forming a disordered, glassy or amorphous structure, and giving pastes their solid-like character.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.2020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rheology of Soft Glassy Materials</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6824/full/410032a0.html#B1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Condensed matter: Memories of paste</a> The authors make a remarkable observation: although the sample was completely fluidized by the large shear stress, it developed a 'memory' of the direction in which the stress was applied, and the solid-like paste slowly 'pulled back' on itself in the opposite direction, eventually passing beyond its initial position.</p>
