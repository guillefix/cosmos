These particles are crowded, or jammed together like grains of sand on a beach, forming a disordered, glassy or amorphous structure, and giving pastes their solid-like character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.2020&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rheology of Soft Glassy Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6824/full/410032a0.html#B1&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Condensed matter: Memories of paste&lt;/a&gt; The authors make a remarkable observation: although the sample was completely fluidized by the large shear stress, it developed a 'memory' of the direction in which the stress was applied, and the solid-like paste slowly 'pulled back' on itself in the opposite direction, eventually passing beyond its initial position.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
