<p>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could Miegakure finally make us &amp;quot;grok&amp;quot; 4 dimensions? I'm not sure, but those 3d/2d animations sure are neat. I think even 3d is hard already.. Specially, when you have only a 2d window to it, and you are forced to use your mind's eye (higher cognition to be precise..) to see the 3d world behind it. **I'm looking at you, FEZ!** ( &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfpKTclOnfI&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfpKTclOnfI&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;</p>
