(2017) recently introduced a causal definition
of fairness, called counterfactual fairness, which states that
a decision is fair toward an individual if it coincides with the
one that would have been taken in a counterfactual world in
which the sensitive attribute were different, and suggested
a general algorithm to achieve this notion</p>
