<p>&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Algebraic%20structure&quot;&gt;Algebraic structure&lt;/a&gt;, studied in &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Group%20theory&quot;&gt;Group theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associtivity, existence of inverse, and identity element..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Monoid&quot;&gt;Monoid&lt;/a&gt; with inverse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoids are one-object categories. We can then identify groups as exactly those one-object categories in which every arrow is an isomorphism. This also leads to a natural generalisation, of considerable importance in current mathematics: a groupoid is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
