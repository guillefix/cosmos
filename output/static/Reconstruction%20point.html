<p>consider the problem of representing a single sample from the source. Let the random variable be represented be X and let the representation of X be denoted as X̂(X). If we are given R bits to represent X, the function X̂ can take on 2 R values. The problem is to find the optimum set of values for X̂ (called the <em>reproduction points</em> or <em>code points</em>) and the regions that are associated with each value X̂</p>
