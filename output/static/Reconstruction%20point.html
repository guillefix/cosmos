<p>&lt;p&gt;consider the problem of representing a single sample from the source. Let the random variable be represented be X and let the representation of X be denoted as X̂(X). If we are given R bits to represent X, the function X̂ can take on 2 R values. The problem is to find the optimum set of values for X̂ (called the &lt;em&gt;reproduction points&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;code points&lt;/em&gt;) and the regions that are associated with each value X̂&lt;/p&gt;</p>
