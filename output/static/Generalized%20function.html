<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generalized function&lt;/strong&gt;, also called &lt;strong&gt;distribution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/dbs26/1BMethods/Distributions.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/dbs26/1BMethods/Distributions.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The are found as limiting cases of functions, where the limit itself is not a function, in the mathematical sense. However, they can be useful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They’re designed to fulfill an apparently mutually contradictory pair of requirements: they are sufficiently well-behaved that they are infinitely differentiable and thus have a chance to satisfy partial differential equations, yet at the same time they can be arbitrarily singular – neither smooth, nor differentiable, nor continuous, nor even &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; – if interpreted naively as 'ordinary functions'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One defines distributions as linear maps from the space of &lt;em&gt;test functions&lt;/em&gt; (smooth functions with compact support) to the Real numbers. One can add distributions, multiply distributions by smooth functions, but in general &lt;em&gt;there is no way to multiply two distributions together&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important example of a distribution that isn't just a function is the &lt;u&gt;Dirac delta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
