However, they can be useful</p><p>&quot;They’re designed to fulfill an apparently mutually contradictory pair of requirements: they are sufficiently well-behaved that they are infinitely differentiable and thus have a chance to satisfy partial differential equations, yet at the same time they can be arbitrarily singular – neither smooth, nor differentiable, nor continuous, nor even <em>finite</em> – if interpreted naively as 'ordinary functions'.</p><p>One defines distributions as linear maps from the space of <em>test functions</em> (smooth functions with compact support) to the Real numbers. One can add distributions, multiply distributions by smooth functions, but in general <em>there is no way to multiply two distributions together</em>.</p><p>The most important example of a distribution that isn't just a function is the <u>Dirac delta</u></p>
