<p>&lt;p&gt;We can state two simple properties of optimal regions and &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Reconstruction%20point&quot;&gt;Reconstruction point&lt;/a&gt;s for the quantization of a single random variable: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given a set { X̂(w)} of reconstruction points, the distortion is mini- mized by mapping a source random variable X to the representation X̂(w) that is closest to it. The set of regions of X defined by this mapping is called a Voronoi or Dirichlet partition defined by the reconstruction points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reconstruction points should minimize the conditional expected distortion over their respective assignment regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two properties enable us to construct a simple algorithm to find a “good” quantizer: We start with a set of reconstruction points, find the opti- mal set of reconstruction regions (which are the nearest-neighbor regions with respect to the distortion measure), then find the optimal reconstruc- tion points for these regions (the centroids of these regions if the distortion is squared error), and then repeat the iteration for this new set of recon- struction points. The expected distortion is decreased at each stage in the algorithm, so the algorithm will converge to a local minimum of the dis- tortion. This algorithm is called the Lloyd algorithm [363] (for real-valued random variables) or the generalized Lloyd algorithm [358] (for vector- valued random variables) and is frequently used to design quantization systems.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
