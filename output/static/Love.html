At the same time, the same technology is allowing these people to express themselves. Humans became a social species to overcome the limitations of a single mind. But what happens when this mind departs further and further from an established social reality. What one needs then is a canvas, a vast white void, in which to paint a new reality. These spaces, made possible by the mythical Tool, are known as heterotopias. Places, where a social reality hasn't yet condensed, and the free interplay of ideas is the norm. Reinvention spaces, cathartic opportunities.
One of the most famous such places was the early Burning Man, because of its scale. However, they have been common and still are, at local scale, around the world-history. Genres like post-cyberpunk and solarpunk and other subgenres of sci-fi, take setting on society or even larger scale heterotopias.
And VRChat, with its many thousands of players, is one of the most literal and promising realizations of this concept.
Hearing the stories of how it's helping people, first-hand, is truly touching.
