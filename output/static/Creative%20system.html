As the control becomes vaguer, the horse resorts to familiar behaviour patterns and takes over control. Being able to “loosen or tighten the reins” leads to smooth ebb and flow of control between human and horse, rather than instructions and responses. Considering feedback and control is key. HCI/ML Researcher Roderick Murray-Smith suggests using the H-Metaphor and control theory when thinking about interface dynamics. He predicts:“Future devices will be able to sense much more on and around them, offering us more ways to interact. We can use this to let go sometimes and be casual about our interactions” [14].</p><p>This analogy is rather clear with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Self-driving%20car">Self-driving car</a>s</p><hr><h2 class=""><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Computer-aided%20design">Assisted Creation</a></h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Tool">Tool</a>s for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Intelligence">thought</a>/<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Art">creation</a></p><p>1949 – Vannevar Bush imagines the “memex”</p><p>1962 – Douglas Engelbart writes Augmenting the Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework – computers can be used to create an extension for the ways we do thinking, representation and association in our minds – systems that augment our intellect, humanity and creativity.
