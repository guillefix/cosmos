<p>&lt;p&gt;The theory of value, also known as axiology, studies what kind of things and outcomes are morally good, or intrinsically valuable. This is in contrast to the theory of the right, which studies what people morally ought to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/theories-of-value/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/theories-of-value/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/accounts-of-well-being/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Well-being&lt;/a&gt; is what is good for a person, or what makes their life go best.
