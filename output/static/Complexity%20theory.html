<p><strong><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Complexity</a></strong> is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=complex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Etimologically</a>, complex refers to a system made of <strong>many intertwined parts</strong>, and that's still the definition we use in science, although a precise measure hasn't been agreed upon. See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Complexity">Complexity</a>.</p><p>But how intertwined, i.e. how many and what kind of the interactions does a system need to be called complex? I think a <strong>complex system</strong> should be defined as one in which the interactions <em>significantly alter</em> the <em>behaviour</em> of the system, relative to the one with no interactions. The primary example of interactions that qualitatively affect the behavior of a system are <strong>nonlinear interactions</strong> (see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Nonlinear%20systems">Nonlinear systems</a>).</p><p><u>Definition by Cosma Shalizi</u>: a complex system is a high-dimensional systems where the variables are strongly interdependent. Complex systems are ones with a large effective number of strongly-interdependent variables. This excludes both low-dimensional systems, and high-dimensional ones where the variables are either independent, or so strongly coupled that only a few variables effectively determine all the rest. Since the 1980s, an interdisciplinary movement of physicists, mathematicians, economists, computer scientists, biologists, anthropologists and other scientists has explored techniques for modeling a broad range of such systems, and their common features and inter-connections. These techniques rely heavily on intensive, sophisticated computer simulations, and notions of information, search and adaptation feature prominently in the theories.

If the system at some coarse-graining level has a behaviour that could be described by a less complex system (for example, as formalized by Kolmogorov complexity in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Algorithmic%20information%20theory">AIT</a>) than the original description, we say it displays organized complexity, and that new simpler behavior has <strong><em>emerged</em></strong> (see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Self-organization">Self-organization</a>). This may also be called <em>complexity reduction</em>. One can see that coarse-graining will produce less complex descriptions, pretty much by definition. However, to get emergence, the system must allow some coarse-graining procedure that produces reasonable descriptions, in the first place</p><p>Disorganized complexity refers to some scale which does not allow a simpler coarse-grained description. </p><p>For example, a gas of particles represent a complex system (as the particles interact with each other in complex ways, i.e. ways that change the behavior of the system significantly relative to a system of non-interacting particles). At the scale of particles, we have disorganized complexity, as there is no coarse-grained description that can simplify the dynamics while still talking of all the particles. We may then use probabilistic descriptions. At larger scales, we can talk about large groups of particles, and using, for instance averages from the probabilistic descriptions, we can construct coarse-grained descriptions in terms of &quot;infinitesimal&quot; volume elements interacting on less complex ways. We can say that that &quot;hydrodynamic behvaior has <em>emerged</em>&quot;.</p><table><tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td>Actually here I am referring to &quot;complexity&quot; as used in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Complex%20systems">Complex systems</a> theory.
