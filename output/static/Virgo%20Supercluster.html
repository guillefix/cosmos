<p>&lt;p&gt;The Virgo Supercluster (Virgo SC) or the Local Supercluster (LSC or LS), one of the millions of superclusters, is a mass concentration of galaxies that contains the Virgo Cluster in addition to the Local Group, which in turn contains the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2014 study indicates that the Virgo Supercluster is only a lobe of a greater supercluster, &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Laniakea%20Supercluster&quot;&gt;Laniakea&lt;/a&gt;, which is centered on the Great Attractor.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
