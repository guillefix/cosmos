<p>&lt;p&gt;When predicting protein structures, normally many different possible structures are made.
These candidate conformations are known as decoys. By making many decoys (generating them computationally), the
probability that one of them closely resembles the true structure of the target protein is
increased - however, since the true structure is unknown, a method must be developed
that can predict which of the decoys is the most accurate. One way of doing this is via the
use of a statistical (or knowledge-based) energy function, known as &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Statistical%20potential&quot;&gt;Statistical potential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22545992&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Network properties of protein-decoy structures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15106995&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Protein decoy sets for evaluating energy functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
