<p>Regression using certain basis function (i.e. find coefficients for a certain linear combination of these that fits the training data). Standard ones are polynomials (see Weirestrass approx theorem, but possible terms become very large as we increase degree).</p><p>Can also use Gaussians, or <em>radial basis functions</em> (RBFs).</p><p>Once kernel functions are used, then can use same methods as for linear regression. Basically, we replace each input datum with the kernel functions evaluated at the input datum.</p><h2 class=""><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://stat.wikia.com/wiki/Kernel_Ridge_Regression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kernel ridge regression</a></h2>
