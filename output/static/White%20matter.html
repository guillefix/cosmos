<p>&lt;p&gt;A part of the &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Cerebrum&quot;&gt;Cerebrum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;98.6% of the axons that run in the white matter lead from one &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Cortex&quot;&gt;cortical&lt;/a&gt; region to another within the same hemisphere. The rest cross the hemispheres (mostly through the corpus callosum), connect some deep nucleus (mostly the thalamus) with specific cortical areas, or connect parts of the brain stem diffusely with widespread areas of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
