<p>The term &quot;perceptron&quot; was introduced in the 1950s to designate
a simple mechanism to achieve &quot;perception.&quot;</p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4cvaztQEs&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599#t=1h10m" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q5twKE9Jeo#t=14m20s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Definition of perceptron</a> </p><p>It is basically a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Feedforward%20neural%20network">Feedforward neural network</a>, with 0 hidden layers, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Heaviside%20step%20function">Heaviside step function</a> activation functions.

book Perceptrons [1969], in which they rigorously demonstrated that
perceptrons are quite limited in their ability to extract global features
from local information. They could only implement linearly separable classification.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q5twKE9Jeo#t=15m50s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Simple storing problem</a>: is a certain training set linearly separable?</p><h2 class=""><u>Multilayer perceptron</u></h2><p>However, the reaction was too drastic, because adding more layers to the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Feedforward%20neural%20network">Feedforward neural network</a> (giving so-called &quot;multilayer perceptrons&quot;), avoided the issues pointed out by Minksy and Papert.</p><p>Multilayered perceptrons work essentially in a manner similar
to the prevailing neurophysiological view. According to this view, on
arrival at the cortex, sensory information is subject to a hierarchy of
feature extractions. Further comparison with the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Cortex">Cortex</a>, is done in the Corticonics book (pages 200-203)</p>
