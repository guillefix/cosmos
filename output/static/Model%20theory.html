<p><em>The study of interpretations of language.</em></p><p>In mathematical model theory, a set of <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sentence_(mathematical_logic)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sentences</a> in a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Formal%20language">Formal language</a> is called a <strong>theory</strong>; a <strong>model</strong> of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation, i.e. <em>something</em>) that satisfies the sentences of that theory. By definition of <em>sentences</em>, we are considering formal languages which are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Formal%20system">Formal system</a>s, typically <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Logic">Logic</a>s</p><p>The nonlogical symbols in the formal system (variables, constants, functions, operators, etc) are called the <strong>signature</strong>. A <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Model%20(Model%20theory)">model</a> for the system should have the same signature, that is, give an interpretation to the symbols in the signature of the language.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/</a></p><p>See also finite model theory</p>
