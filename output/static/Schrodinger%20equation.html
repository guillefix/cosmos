<p>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Boris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thinking about it, I think I get what you said about entropy maximization resulting in &lt;T&gt; and &lt;V&gt; being equal. That's just the Equipartition theorem !

As to why we should expect entropy maximization to act here. Well, I don't know if you know, but the Schrodinger equation can be written as a Fokker-Planck equation (up to an i). FP equation tends to Boltzmann distribution (maximum entropy distribution up to constraints). At the end of the day this would probably be equivalent to Feynman's way of deriving the principle of least action from path integrals (in there, one takes h–&amp;gt;0. In the FP eq from the Schrodinger eq, h ~ 1/(diffusion constant), so h–&amp;gt; 0 makes equilibration happen infinitely fast, so all the trajectory is at maximum entropy!)

But I think the idea of using entropy maximization to do this, is pretty cool! I think you should write it down, if you haven't already :) I'd be interested to see it

Now that I get this better, I do think that the question of entropymaximization and sloppiness is interesting, and worth thinking about..&lt;/V&gt;&lt;/T&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
