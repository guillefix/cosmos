<p>A funnction that is a linear combination of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Convex%20function">Convex function</a>s where the weights can be negative. Equivalently, it is a linear combination of convex and concave functions.</p><p>If it is a function to be <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Optimization">optimized</a>, there is an efficient method, where we approximate the concave functions in the linear combination by a hyperplane (linear approx, using <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Taylor%20expansion">Taylor expansion</a>). We then have a convex function overall, which we can optimize using <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Convex%20optimization">Convex optimization</a> methods. We then re-approximate the concave functions linearly in the newly found point, and repeat!</p>
