<p>A kind of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Markov%20chain%20Monte%20Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a>, where we sample from the conditional posterior distribution with for a parameter, with all other parameters fixed. This is repeated for all parameters. Eventually the MCMC converges to the real posterior.</p>
