The fact that practically every concept class known to be eciently learnable
in the Valiant model can in fact be learned from statistical queries (and thus with classication noise) raises the natural question of whether the two models
are equivalent. We answer this question negatively in Section 7 by proving that
the class of parity concepts, known to be eciently learnable in the Valiant
model, cannot be eciently learned from statistical queries. The class of parity
concepts is also notorious for having no known ecient noise-tolerant algorithm</p>
