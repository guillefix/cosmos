<p>&lt;p&gt;There is no way of expressing the notion of &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; in sufficiently powerful &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Formal%20system&quot;&gt;Formal system&lt;/a&gt;s, such as TNT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there was a way, one could represent &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Epiminede's%20paradox&quot;&gt;Epiminede's paradox&lt;/a&gt;, with a formula with G number T.  If the Tarski formula T actually existed, then it would be a statement about natural numbers that is both true and false at once (or neither)!  If we believe this is a ridiculous state of affairs, then we have to undo our assumption that the formula TRUE{a} exists . Thus, there is no way of expressing the notion of truth inside TNT. Notice that this makes truth a far more elusive property than theoremhood, for the latter is expressible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this assumes, a priori facts about how truth works, I guess as axioms of &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Logic&quot;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Godel%2C%20Escher%2C%20Bach&quot;&gt;Godel, Escher, Bach&lt;/a&gt;, page 581&lt;/p&gt;</p>
