However, in real-life materials, a significant fraction of these chains bind to themselves, forming defects—floppy loops that weaken the network.
These loops also make it impossible to accurately calculate the material's elasticity, because existing formulas for this calculation assume that the material has no defects.</p><p>The new method, <u>network disassembly spectrometry</u> allowed them to measure the number of loops, and see its effect on <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Elasticity">Elasticity</a>.  They also developed a new theory, as previous models didn't predict what they measured.
