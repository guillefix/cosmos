However, to prove two things are not homeomorphic you have to prove that no mapping will be a homemorphism! Because there may be too many maps to check, one most often has to find a topological invariant, that is different in the two spaces, to prove this.</p><p>Some examples of topological properties/invariants (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Topological%20property">Topological property</a>):</p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Hausdorff%20space">Hausdorff</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Connectedness">Connectedness</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Second%20countable">Second countable</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Compactness">Compactness</a></li><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Fundamental%20group">Fundamental group</a></li></ul><p>A continuous <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Open%20function">Open function</a> is a homeomorphism</p><hr><p>In the mathematical field of topology, a homeomorphism or topological isomorphism or bi continuous function is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function.  Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces—that is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic, and from a topological viewpoint they are the same. The word homeomorphism comes from the Greek words ὅμοιος (homoios) = similar and μορφή (morphē) = shape, form.[1].
