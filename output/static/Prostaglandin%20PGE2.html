<p>&lt;p&gt;Prostaglandin PGE2 is a candidate molecule for potentiating regeneration in multiple different tissues. PGE2 is produced by the enzyme activity of cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-1 and COX-2) followed sequentially by that of prostaglandin E synthase. These come from anachidonic acid..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PGE2 augments Wnt signaling (10, 11), a pathway that is involved in the maintenance of several types of tissue stem cells, including hematopoietic and colon stem cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It promotes &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Tissue%20regeneration&quot;&gt;Tissue regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, and is thus used as a target in &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Regenerative%20medicine&quot;&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
