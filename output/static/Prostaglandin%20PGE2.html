<p>Prostaglandin PGE2 is a candidate molecule for potentiating regeneration in multiple different tissues. PGE2 is produced by the enzyme activity of cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-1 and COX-2) followed sequentially by that of prostaglandin E synthase. These come from anachidonic acid..</p><p>PGE2 augments Wnt signaling (10, 11), a pathway that is involved in the maintenance of several types of tissue stem cells, including hematopoietic and colon stem cells</p><p>It promotes <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Tissue%20regeneration">Tissue regeneration</a>, and is thus used as a target in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Regenerative%20medicine">Regenerative medicine</a></p>
