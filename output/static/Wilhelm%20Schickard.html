Schickard's machine could perform basic arithmetic operations on integer inputs. His letters to Kepler, discoverer of the laws of planetary motion, explain the application of his &quot;calculating clock&quot; to the computation of astronomical tables.</p><p>The non- programmable Schickard machine was based on the traditional decimal system. Leibniz subsequently discovered the more convenient binary system (1679), an essential ingredient of the world's first working program- controlled computer, due to Zuse (1941).&quot;</p>
