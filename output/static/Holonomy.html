<p>The fact that parallel transporting a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Tangent%20vector">vector</a> in a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Riemannian%20manifold">Riemannian manifold</a> with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Connection%20(Geometry)">connection</a> around a closed loop can lead to different vectors; thus there is not a unique notion of &quot;parallel&quot; vectors at two different points in a general manifold.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Holonomy%20group">Holonomy group</a></p>
