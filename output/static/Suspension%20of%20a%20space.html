<p>&lt;p&gt;For a space X , the suspension SX is the quotient of X × I obtained by collapsing X × {0} to one point and X × {1} to another point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Reduced%20suspension%20of%20a%20space&quot;&gt;Reduced suspension of a space&lt;/a&gt;. Let X be a CW complex and x 0 ∈ X a 0 cell.
Inside the suspension SX we have the line segment {x 0 }× I , and collapsing this to a
point yields a space ΣX homotopy equivalent to SX , called the reduced suspension of X.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
