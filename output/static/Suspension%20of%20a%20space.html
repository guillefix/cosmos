<p>For a space X , the suspension SX is the quotient of X × I obtained by collapsing X × {0} to one point and X × {1} to another point.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Reduced%20suspension%20of%20a%20space">Reduced suspension of a space</a>. Let X be a CW complex and x 0 ∈ X a 0 cell.
Inside the suspension SX we have the line segment {x 0 }× I , and collapsing this to a
point yields a space ΣX homotopy equivalent to SX , called the reduced suspension of X.</p>
