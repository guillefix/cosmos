<p><strong>Chromostereopsis</strong> is a visual illusion whereby the impression of depth is conveyed in two-dimensional color images, usually of red-blue or red-green colors, but can also be perceived with red-grey or blue-grey images. Such illusions have been reported for over a century and have generally been attributed to some form of chromatic aberration.</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yUHl7jf.png"></p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chromostereopsis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chromostereopsis</a></p>
