<p>In this duplication-divergence (DD) model the duplicate node loses some of the original links and creates new links. At each iteration t a node is chosen uniformly at random (parent) and duplicated by adding a new node to the graph (child) which retains all edges incident to the parent node. Then (i) delete each edge in the child node independently with probability q ; (ii) each node in the graph is independently connected to the child node with probability r / t . If a singleton is produced, this node will be connected to at least one uniformly chosen random node</p><p>Bebek et al., 2006</p>
