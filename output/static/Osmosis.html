<p><strong>Osmosis</strong> is the spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a semi-permeable membrane into a region of higher solute concentration, in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis</a></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hpT5CCW.png"></p><p>It is often described by a &quot;solvent potential&quot;, which is lowered by the addition of solute, and raised by increases in hydrostatic pressure. Thus, the solvent tends to flow from regions of lower to higher solute concentration, and this tendency can be countered by a sufficiently large pressure difference. However, the physical mechanisms that cause this are tricky.

Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity.</p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Fluid%20mechanics">Fluid mechanics</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Thermodynamics">Thermodynamics</a>.
