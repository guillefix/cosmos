<p>A type of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Machine%20learning">Machine learning</a> problem where only some of the labels ('outputs') are available in the training data, the rest of the training data being just 'inputs'.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Generative%20model">Generative model</a>s are often used for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Feature%20learning">Feature learning</a> from the whole input data set, and then using the learned features, a model can be trained with the few labelled samples.
