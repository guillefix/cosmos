We do not share personal information with companies, organisations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the
following circumstances applies:
With your consent
We will share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside Google when we have your
consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
With domain administrators
If your Google Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for example, for G Suite users) then your domain
administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organisation will have access to your Google Account
information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to:
view statistics regarding your account, such as statistics regarding applications that you install.
change your account password.
suspend or terminate your account access.
access or retain information stored as part of your account.
receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
governmental request.
restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.
Please refer to your domain administratorâ€™s privacy policy for more information.
For external processing
We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our
instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
For legal reasons
We will share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside Google if we have a belief in
good faith that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public, as required or permitted
by law.
