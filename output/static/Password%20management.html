Furthermore, using letters from the site reduces the entropy more because they may be easy to guess. Finally, and most importantly. The mutual information between your passwords of different sites is extremely high, meaning that if someone hacked you the one for one site, it'd be very easy to brute force it for another site.</p><p>I'm finding that actually I am able to remember random strings of 18 characters (85 bits of entropy) for the most important passwords. With some mnemonic tricks it should be possible to learn many more passwords like this.
Furthermore, an idea a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Paco%20Criado">friend</a> had was to use a cryptographically secure random number generator, with a high entropy + some code for the site you are using as seeds. This way, one can effectively have more entropy for less, and probably have, by remembering a fixed amount of entropy (100-300 bits lets say), super secure passwords for hundreds of sites, all which share almost no information between them (they are all effectively unique).
He had the idea of using a deck of cards to implement the algorithm, so that it was easy to recover in case of emergency. However, for every day use, you may use a password manager, as well as the mnemonic tricks to remember the important ones.</p></div>
