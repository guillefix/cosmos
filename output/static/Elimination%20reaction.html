<p>An elimination reaction is a type of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Chemical%20reaction">Chemical reaction</a>, often an <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Organic%20reaction">Organic reaction</a>, in which two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one or two-step mechanism, usually through the action of acids, bases, or metals and, in some cases, by heating to a high temperature. It is the principal process by which organic compounds containing only single carbon-carbon bonds (saturated compounds) are transformed to compounds containing double or triple carbon-carbon bonds (unsaturated compounds).</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry/substitution-elimination-reactions/e1-e2-tutorial/v/e1-elimination-mechanism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Video</a></p><p>The one-step mechanism is known as the E2 reaction, and the two-step mechanism is known as the E1 reaction. The numbers do not have to do with the number of steps in the mechanism, but rather the kinetics of the reaction, bimolecular and unimolecular respectively.</p><h2 class=""><u>E1  mechanism</u></h2><p>Two-step mechanism</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elimination_reaction#/E1_mechanism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elimination_reaction#/E1_mechanism</a></p><h2 class=""><u>E2 mechanism</u></h2><p>One-step mechanism</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elimination_reaction#/E2_mechanism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elimination_reaction#/E2_mechanism</a></p>
