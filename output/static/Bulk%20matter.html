<p><strong>Bulk matter</strong> refers to a piece of <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#Based_on_quarks_and_leptons" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">matter</a> composed of sufficiently many building blocks (elementary particles, atoms, molecules, ...) in such a way that <u>a simple <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Statistical%20physics">statistical</a> description is appropriate</u>, an bulk properties like temperature, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Viscosity%20and%20elasticity">Viscosity and elasticity</a>, etc can be defined. These are also called <em>material properties</em> or <em>macroscopic properties</em>.</p><p>Bulk matter can be either composed of a single <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Phase%20transition">phase</a> or a mixture of phases; see for instance <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Dispersion%20(Chemistry)">dispersions</a>.</p><p>I use the term &quot;form&quot; of matter to refer to a particular type of bulk matter: either a single phase or a mixture of phases. I also use the world <em>material</em> (see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Materials%20science">Materials science</a>) mostly to refer to a particular form of matter. I think that &quot;phase&quot; is sometimes used more widely in the same sense as I use the term &quot;form&quot;.</p><p><u>When is a system bulk matter?</u></p><p>Note that many pieces of matter are formed by components interacting in complicated ways, in such a way that a simple statistical description does not appropriately describe its behaviour for many purposes; for instance, a computer, or a cell. These are in most situations not considered as bulk matter, and should be treated as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Complex%20systems">Complex systems</a> instead. However, whether a statistical description is appropriate, and therefore whether they are considered bulk matter, really depends on the problem, and so for some problems, these systems can be considered bulk matter (for instance, when studying the overall mechanical strength of a computer system). From here on, &quot;matter&quot; refers to bulk matter, unless otherwise specified. </p><h2 class=""><u>Classification</u></h2><p>Bulk matter can be classified depending on whether the phase (see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Condensed%20matter%20physics">Condensed matter physics</a> for more detailed explanation):</p><ul><li>is <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Condensed%20matter%20physics">condensed or non-condensed</a>.</li><li>is a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Fluid%20mechanics">fluid</a>, a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Solid%20mechanics">solid</a>, or a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Viscoelasticity">viscoelastic material</a>, depending on its <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Viscosity%20and%20elasticity">elasticity</a> properties.
