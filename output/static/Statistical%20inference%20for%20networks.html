<h2 class="">Inference based on motifs</h2><p>Compare relative to some null model, like the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Configuration%20model">Configuration model</a>, where –.–, and Y motifs are common,  but cycles are rare, for instance.</p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/55cvuaj578c92z4/networklectures2017.pdf?dl=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notes</a></p><p>Often a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Polya-Aeppli%20distribution">Polya-Aeppli distribution</a> is suggested for motif counts, see Picard et al. 2008 . The Polya-Aeppli distribution is the distribution of W where W is the sum of a Poisson ( λ ) number of random variables, where each of the random variables follows a geometric(1 − a ) distribution, independently of each other (see the Monte Carlo example). In the random graph network, we can think of having a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Poisson%20distribution">Poisson</a> number of &quot;clumps&quot;, and each clump having a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Geometric%20distribution">geometric</a> size.</p><p>When assessing the significance of two or more motifs, their dependence has to be taken into account, or else we resort to the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Bonferroni%20correction">Bonferroni correction</a>, dividing the significance level of our tests by the number of tests carried out and using this as new significance level for each individual test.</p><p><strong>Bonferroni correction</strong>: have 100 tests. I want a statistical significance (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#p-value">p-value</a>) of 0.05. Then, each test should be performed with significance 0.05/100. Gets a lot of false negatives, but it really tries to prevent false positives. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Metabolomics">Metabolomics</a> has a lot of tests, and so there are other alternatives..., but not an exact science..</p><p>Ego networks can be used to get replicas (samples) from same network.
