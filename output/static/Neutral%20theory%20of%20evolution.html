<p><strong>Kimura's neutral theory of evolution</strong>. He proposed that (at least for molecular evolution) most mutations are neutral, meaning that they don't lead to a change in fitness.</p><p>Because different phenotypes often do have different fitness, the way this comes about is because of the large redundancy in GP maps.</p><p>When the redundancy is large enough for some phenotype, or there are genetic correlations, so that nearby genotypes (in mutation network) tend to map to the same phenotype, we find large <strong>neutral spaces</strong>. If Kimura is right, most mutations occurs within these spaces, and are governed by genetic drift, random changes in allele frequencies in finite populations, not governed by natural selection.</p><p><strong>Genotype space</strong>, links represent single-point mutations. It has a hypercube network structure.</p><p><strong>Neutral spaces</strong> or neutral sets are those sets of genotypes that produce the same phenotype.
