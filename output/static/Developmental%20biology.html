distinct problems here. One is that of cellular differentiation: how do different cells, sharing 
exactly the same DNA, perform different roles-
such as a kidney cell, a bone marrow cell, and 
a  brain  cell?  The  other  is  that  of  morphogenesis  (&quot;birth  of  form&quot;):  how  does  intercellular  
communication  on  a  local  level  give  rise  to  large-scale,  global  structures  and  organizations-
such as the various organs of the body, the shape of the face, the suborgans of the brain, and 
so  on?  Although  both  cellular  differentiation  and  rnorphogenesis  are  poorly  understood  at  
present.  the  trick  appears  to  reside  in  exquisitely  fine-tuned  feedback  and  &quot;feedforward&quot;  
mechanisms within cells and between cells, which tell a cell when to &quot;turn on&quot; and when to 
&quot;turn off&quot; production of various proteins. </sub></p>
