<p>&lt;p&gt;An issue that has caused a lot of problems in the &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing&quot; href=&quot;#Korea&quot;&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is allegued that Japan forcefully took women and mistreated them as sex slaves during WWII. However, it is also argued that most of these cases were legitimate and not unethical, with the women being treated well, and just being recruited to offer a service in the military. Furthermore, the issues with the ways they were treated go beyond the Japan-Korean relations, ethnic discrimination, and war. They point at deeper issues with imperalism/nationalism/patriarchy and the way women, and poor people (classism?) are treated! The issues of agency and power dynamics are also related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Sewook&quot;&gt;Sewook&lt;/a&gt; organized a talk and panel discussion where he invited Proff Park Yu-Ha (&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/2084216308512858/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/2084216308512858/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(an e.g. a panelist gave from some OxFam case: When you go to a poor country, an you pay some prostitutes, you may be abusing your position of power, and not doing the humane/moral thing, even if the same action on a ritch country would have been ok...)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
