<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Proof that square root of two is irrational&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine the Pythagorean squares associated with the sides of a right-angle triangle with equal leg sizes. By the Pythagorean theorem, the square corresponding to the hypotenuse has the same area as the sum of the squares of the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if the ratio was a rational number, then one could choose a size for squares such that an integer number of them fitted on the sides of the triangles, and similarly the squares could be partitioned into these unit squares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that the number of unit squares in the big square equals the sum of the number of unit squares in the squares of the legs, but as these are equal, this is just twice the number of unit squares from one leg. Therefore the number of unit squares in the big square must be even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the number of unit squares is even, cutting the square in half perpendicular to a side should give an integer number of squares. If the number of unit squares in a side wasn't even, cutting by a half would cut unit squares by a half. And there would be as many of these half unit squares in each half as there are unit squares in a side of the square. As the number in each half must be integer, this number must be even, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the number of unit squares in a side is even. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we begun choosing the minimum ratio between the sides, this means that the number of unit squares in a leg is not even, for it were we could just halve the number of squares in both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now considering cutting the initial right-hand triangle in half parallel to the hypotenuse. As the number of unit squares in the hypotenuse was shown to be even, the number of unit squares in the half-hypotenuse is an integer. Now the triangle formed by this segment and the leg of the original triangle is geometrically similar to the original triangle, and their sides are partitioned into integers. However, the leg, which acts as the hypotenuse of the new triangle, doesn't have an even integer number of unit squares, while we just showed that it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the initial assumption that there was such an integer ratio must be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
