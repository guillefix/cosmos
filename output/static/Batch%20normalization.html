They call this change the internal covariate shift. They propose to normalize the activations (to have zero mean and unit variance) to avoid this.</p><p>These have been found to work better for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Convolutional%20neural%20network">Convolutional neural network</a>s for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Image%20classification">Image classification</a>. I think this may be because for images, you care more about relative differences between pixel values, and so normalizing helps remove unimportant information.</p>
