A molecule or ion with such delocalized electrons is represented by several contributing structures[2] (also called <strong>resonance structures</strong> or canonical structures).</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry/organic-structures/formal-charge-resonance/v/resonance-intro-jay" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a></p><p>These are found, for instance, in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Aromatic%20compound">Aromatic compound</a>s, like <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Benzene">Benzene</a></p><h3 class=""><u>Conjugated systems</u></h3><p>Resonance is most often found in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Conjugated%20system">Conjugated system</a>s</p>
