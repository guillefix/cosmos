<p>&lt;p&gt;im a bayesian frequentist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think of almost all probability as fundamentally frequentist, but because of our incomplete knowledge/computational resources we make subjective and simplifying assumptions which are best carried out in a Bayesian framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the deepest probabilistic questions, I think are fundamentally subjective, and so foundamentally Bayesian (see my #philosophy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;probability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Philosophy%20of%20quantum%20mechanics&quot;&gt;Philosophy of quantum mechanics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Philosophy%20of%20statistical%20mechanics&quot;&gt;Philosophy of statistical mechanics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
