evaluation function for my own system. I continued working on this with no
great success until 1958, when I decided to look at Chomsky's paper more
closely. It was easy for me to understand and build upon. In a short time, I
devised a fast left to right parser for context free languages and an extremely
fast matrix parser for context sensitive languages
It took advantage of special
32 bit parallel processing instructions that most computers have
My main interest, however, was learning. I was trying to find an algo
rithm for the discovery of the &quot;best&quot; grammar for a given set of acceptable
sentences. One of the things sought for: Given a set of positive cases of ac
ceptable sentences and several grammars, any of which is able to generate all
of the sentences
what goodness of fit criterion should be used? It is clear
that the &quot;Ad-hoc grammar
that lists all of the sentences in the corpus, fits
perfectly. The &quot;promiscuous grammar&quot; that accepts any conceivable sentence
also fits perfectly. The first grammar has a long description, the second has a
short description. It seemed that some grammar half way between these, was
but what criterion should be used?
correct
There are other modes of learning in which the &quot;goodness of fit&quot; criterion is
clearer</p></blockquote><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=XAOE5V9B4dUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;ots=rbA1pmUJgB&amp;sig=wjS3fuyps3_LPb3YH6hoSaz6zIY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=XAOE5V9B4dUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;ots=rbA1pmUJgB&amp;sig=wjS3fuyps3_LPb3YH6hoSaz6zIY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-33486-6_7#page-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-33486-6_7#page-1</a></p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Evolving%20automata">Evolving automata</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/crypto.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cryptographic limitations on learning boolean formulae and finite automata</a></p>
