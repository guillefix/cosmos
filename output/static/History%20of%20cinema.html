Paul</a>'s Come Along, Do!, made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Robert_William_Paul.jpg" width="200"></p><p>In 1900, continuity of action across successive shots was definitively established by George Albert Smith and James Williamson, who also worked in Brighton. In that year Smith made As Seen Through a Telescope, in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene. Even more remarkable is James Williamson's Attack on a China Mission Station (1900). The first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the balcony, who come and rescue them. The film also used the first &quot;reverse angle&quot; cut in film history.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Albert_Smith_(film_pioneer)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">George Albert Smith (film pioneer)</a> </p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/18/G.A.Smith.jpg"></p><p><strong>Science fiction and special effects</strong>. <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Georges%20M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s">Georges Méliès</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sergei Eisenstein</a></p>
