<p><em>how to approximate continuous maps with simplicial maps</em></p><p>Most commonly studied <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Topological%20space">Topological space</a>s admit the structure of a simplicial complex. If K and L are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Simplicial%20complex">Simplicial complex</a>es, and f: |K| → |L| is some
continuous map between their topological realization, it will be very useful to be able to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Homotopy">homotope</a> f to a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Simplicial%20map">Simplicial map</a>. In general, this is not always possible. But it is if we pass to a ‘sufficiently fine’ subdivision of K:</p><p><strong>Simplicial approximation theorem</strong>.  <em>Let K and L be simplicial complexes,
where K is finite, and let f: |K| → |L| be a continuous map. Then there is some
