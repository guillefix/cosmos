<p>You see, &quot;Mu&quot; is
an ancient Zen answer which, when given to a question, UNASKs the
question. Here, the question seems to be, &quot;Should the world be under
stood via holism, or via reductionism?&quot; And the answer of &quot;MU&quot; rejects the premises of the question, which are that one or the other
must be chosen. By unasking the question, it reveals <strong>a wider truth: that
there is a larger context into which both holistic and reductionistic
explanations fit</strong>.
