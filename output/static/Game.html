A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive. Movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment.
If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.
If a challenge has no &quot;active agent against whom you compete,&quot; it is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict. (Crawford admits that this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.)
Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a competition. (Competitions include racing and figure skating.) However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game.</p><h2 class=""><u>Mathematical study of games</u></h2><h3 class=""><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Game%20theory">Game theory</a></u></h3><h3 class=""><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Combinatorial%20game%20theory">Combinatorial game theory</a></u></h3>
