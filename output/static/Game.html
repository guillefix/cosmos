A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive. Movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment.
If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.
If a challenge has no &amp;quot;active agent against whom you compete,&amp;quot; it is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict. (Crawford admits that this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.)
Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a competition. (Competitions include racing and figure skating.) However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mathematical study of games&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Game%20theory&quot;&gt;Game theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Combinatorial%20game%20theory&quot;&gt;Combinatorial game theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
