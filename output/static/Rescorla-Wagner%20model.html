<p>&lt;p&gt;See sec 14.2.2 in &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Sutton-Barto&quot;&gt;Sutton-Barto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rescorla and Wagner created their model mainly to account for blocking. The core
idea of the Rescorlaâ€“Wagner model is that an animal only learns when events violate
its expectations, in other words, only when the animal is surprised (although with-
out necessarily implying any conscious expectation or emotion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be interpreted as &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Stochastic%20gradient%20descent&quot;&gt;Stochastic gradient descent&lt;/a&gt; to minimize the expected square error of a linear model between stimuli and responses (where the true response is determined by the unconditioned stimulus)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
