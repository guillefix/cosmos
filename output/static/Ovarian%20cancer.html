<p>&lt;p&gt;Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecologic cancer, in large part because of its early dissemination and rapid development of chemotherapy resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dissemination&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spheroids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheroids are clusters of tumor cells found in the &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Peritoneum&quot;&gt;peritoneal&lt;/a&gt; fluid of patients that are thought to promote this dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23213456&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spontaneous spheroid budding from monolayers: a potential contribution to ovarian cancer dissemination.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;in vitro experiments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheroids can be produced from many cancer cell lines under conditions that favor cell-cell over cell-matrix adhesion
&lt;sub&gt;Not all cancer cell lines form spheroids, and the features that allow spheroid growth are not well characterized. &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major property is the resistance of spheroid cells to cytotoxic drugs compared to the same cells grown as monolayers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;drug resistance is proposed to arise from one or more factors, including creation of a physical barrier to drug penetration; induction of genes or signalling pathways that enhance survival, such as drug efflux pumps; and selection for a subpopulation of drug-resistant cells, which could include cancer stem cells&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€“&amp;gt;In the experiments in the paper, the resistance could be completely reversed by dissociating the spheroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;spheroid formation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current models suggest that spheroids form by aggregation of single tumor cells shed from the primary tumor. Another mechanicsm is clonal expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;spheroids can also form by budding directly as adherent clusters from a monolayer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiment suggests that the ability to form budded spheroids does not require supplemental serum or growth factors added to the spheroid media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spheroid budding correlates with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
