<p>Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecologic cancer, in large part because of its early dissemination and rapid development of chemotherapy resistance.</p><h2 class=""><u>Dissemination</u></h2><h3 class=""><u>Spheroids</u></h3><p>Spheroids are clusters of tumor cells found in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Peritoneum">peritoneal</a> fluid of patients that are thought to promote this dissemination.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23213456" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spontaneous spheroid budding from monolayers: a potential contribution to ovarian cancer dissemination.</a></p><p><u>in vitro experiments</u></p><p>Spheroids can be produced from many cancer cell lines under conditions that favor cell-cell over cell-matrix adhesion
<sub>Not all cancer cell lines form spheroids, and the features that allow spheroid growth are not well characterized. </sub></p><p><u>resistance</u></p><p>A major property is the resistance of spheroid cells to cytotoxic drugs compared to the same cells grown as monolayers</p><p><sub>drug resistance is proposed to arise from one or more factors, including creation of a physical barrier to drug penetration; induction of genes or signalling pathways that enhance survival, such as drug efflux pumps; and selection for a subpopulation of drug-resistant cells, which could include cancer stem cells</sub></p><p>â€“&gt;In the experiments in the paper, the resistance could be completely reversed by dissociating the spheroids.</p><p><u>spheroid formation</u></p><p>Current models suggest that spheroids form by aggregation of single tumor cells shed from the primary tumor. Another mechanicsm is clonal expansion.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that <em>spheroids can also form by budding directly as adherent clusters from a monolayer</em></p><p>Their experiment suggests that the ability to form budded spheroids does not require supplemental serum or growth factors added to the spheroid media.</p><p><em>Spheroid budding correlates with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers</em></p>
