Basically, infinite results are always described as a limit of a sequence of finite results. And these finite results themselves are useful. The concept of infinity is still useful because it allows to understand and summarize these finite results in simple ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;perhaps only those concepts to do with infinity which can be expressed as a a limit of finite concepts are useful&lt;/p&gt;</p>
