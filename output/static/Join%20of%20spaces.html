<p>&lt;p&gt;The cone CX is the union of all line segments joining points of X to an external
vertex, and similarly the suspension SX is the union of all line segments joining
points of X to two external vertices. More generally, given X and a second space Y ,
one can define the space of all line segments joining points in X to points in Y . This
is the join X ∗ Y , the quotient space of X × Y × I under the identifications (x, y 1 , 0) ∼
(x, y 2 , 0) and (x 1 , y, 1) ∼ (x 2 , y, 1). Points in the join can be written as formal convex combinations, and can be extended to joins of several spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the join of n points is a convex polyhedron of
dimension n − 1 called a &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Simplex&quot;&gt;Simplex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
