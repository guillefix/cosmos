In addition, for given available surface properties, our calculation framework provides a guide for optimizing the design of swimmers. </dd></dl><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="file:///home/guillefix/Dropbox/Oxford/MMathPhys/topics%20in%20soft%20and%20active%20matter/ramin/njp07_design-swimmer.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Designing phoretic micro- and nano-swimmers (pdf)</a></p><table><tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Self-diffusiophoresis">Self-diffusiophoresis</a>, and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Diffusiophoresis">Diffusiophoresis</a> for theory</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="">Designs of self-diffusiophoretic particles</h2><h3 class=""><u>Spherical</u></h3><p><u>Janus particle</u></p><p><u>Saturn particle</u></p><p><u>Three-slice design</u></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vw3Qp4f.png"></p><h3 class=""><u>Thin rod</u></h3><p>Use slender body theory</p><hr><p>Is there a way for particles to actively &quot;fight&quot; their rotational diffusion and make them go straight for longer, without an external field?</p>
