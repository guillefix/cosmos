Furthermore, all these need to be approached from the perspective of helping students develop adaptive expertise (principle 6), which includes helping them become metacognitive about their learning so that they can assess their own progress and continually identify and pursue new learning goals. Metacognition can help students develop personally rel- evant pedagogical content knowledge, analogous to the pedagogical con- tent knowledge available to effective teachers (principle 5). In short, stu- dents need to develop the ability to teach themselves.

The primary intuition behind the ART model is that object identification and recognition generally occur as a result of the interaction of 'top-down' observer expectations with 'bottom-up' sensory information. The model postulates that <b>'top-down' expectations take the form of a memory template or prototype that is then compared with the actual features of an object as detected by the senses</b>. This comparison gives rise to a measure of category belongingness. As long as this difference between sensation and expectation does not exceed a set threshold called the 'vigilance parameter', the sensed object will be considered a member of the expected class. The system thus offers a solution to the 'plasticity/stability' problem, i.e. the problem of acquiring new knowledge without disrupting existing knowledge.</p>
