For loss functions with attainable, finite, minimizers, such as the squared loss, we have some understanding of this: In particular, when minimizing an underdetermined least squares problem using gradient descent starting from the origin, we know we will <strong>converge to the minimum Euclidean norm solution</strong>. But the logistic loss, and its generalization the cross-entropy loss which is often used in deep learning, do not admit a finite minimizer on separable problems. Instead, to drive the loss toward zero and thus minimize it, the predictor must diverge toward infinity.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01953.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Implicit regularization in deep learning</a></p><hr><p>But we didn't tell the network to minimize the path norm (complexity). <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACdjYP0-cMw#t=39m5s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">So where is the regularization coming from?</a>.
