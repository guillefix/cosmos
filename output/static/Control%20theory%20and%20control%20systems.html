Indeed, a switched controller can provide a performance improvement over a fixed controller </p><p>Switched systems consist of a decision layer and a control layer. The former is logical, i.e., discrete, and decides at a given time, which subsystem is activated. The latter usually corresponds to a set of normal control systems.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=186313&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D186313" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Periodicity and chaos from switched Mow systems: Contrasting examples of discretely controlled continuous systems</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0005-1098(01)00267-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Controllability and reachability criteria for switched linear systems</a></p><p>Switching in Systems and Control</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000510980800383X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On partitioned controllability of switched linear systems</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751570X15000588" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Finite automata approach to observability of switched Boolean control networks</a>.
