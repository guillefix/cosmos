The main explanation I can find (given that there are many things yet unknown, such as the roles spatial, temporal, and neural encoding play) is mentioned here: &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/The-Musical-Ear/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/The-Musical-Ear/&lt;/a&gt; The basilar membrane is known to certainly play a role in pitch perception. Now, most times we hear a frequency we hear it from some object (like an instrument) that generates harmonics of that frequency (ultimately due to ratios of lengths and linear dispersion relations). Now, harmonic frequencies (with simple ratios as you say) share a lot of harmonics themselves. These will excite the basilar membrane in the same spots. And as long as the harmonics don't differ by more than about 10Hz, they will be indistinguishable (as far as the basilar membrane is concerned, due to bandwidth). However, if you make to non harmonic sounds with two non-conmensurate objects, a lot of their harmonics will  be very close, and within the so called critical frequency, which has been shown to cause dissonant perception. Now, a plausible theory for why even pure sinusodial waves at simple ratios tend to sound better (though I did the test now, two non-harmonic sin waves don't sound nearly as bad as two non-harmonic piano notes), may be that the brain develops neuronal networks to prefer these sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your theory of the brain detecting the rhythms is still interesting though, and may be relevant to the &amp;quot;temporal coding&amp;quot; theoreis that have been proposed, but I have not read much about those..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;http://plasticity.szynalski.com/tone-generator.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://plasticity.szynalski.com/tone-generator.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gAvUBwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA64&amp;amp;lpg=PA64&amp;amp;dq=Basilar+membrane+harmony&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=Q5Q0ORrlbs&amp;amp;sig=EfeuL2zPqDSMu1JbJcowhRJG4K8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg9N7bmeTKAhWGvA8KHSEJB4YQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Basilar%20membrane%20harmony&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Neural Code of Pitch and Harmony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilar_membrane&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilar_membrane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_%28music%29#Theories_of_pitch_perception&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_%28music%29#Theories_of_pitch_perception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance#Physiological_basis_of_dissonance&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance#Physiological_basis_of_dissonance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_psychology#Neural_correlates_of_musical_training&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_psychology#Neural_correlates_of_musical_training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics#Music&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics#Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink-external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Music and measure theory&lt;/a&gt; The reason it works so well to have twelve notes in the chromatic scale is that powers of the twelveth root of two tend to be within a 1% margin of error of simple rational numbers. And it's good to have powers of the same factor for the notes, because the brain perceives separation between frequencies logarithmically not linearly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
