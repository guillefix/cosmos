It can mean two things: (a) the use of randomness (e.g., random graphs) to solve deterministic combinatorial problems, or (b) the study of random combinatorial objects for their own sake. Historically, the main focus was initially on (a), but after a while, the same objects (e.g., random graphs) come up again and again, and one realizes that it is not only important, but also interesting, to study these in themselves, as well as their applications. Random graphs have also been intensively studied as mathematical models for disordered networks in the real world. Probabilis-tic combinatorics has also led to new developments in probability theory, and interacts strongly with theoretical computer science. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Method%20of%20moments">Method of moments</a></p><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#First-moment%20method">First-moment method</a></li></ul><p>The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Probabilistic%20method">Probabilistic method</a> is the main idea in probabilistic combinatorics (for the objective (a) above). It involves the following idea, if the probability of event {we get some structure X} under a random process defined on a set of combinatorial structures is greater than <span><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mord mathrm">0</span></span></span></span></span>, then that X structure must exist.
