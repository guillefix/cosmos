<p>&lt;p&gt;A particular kind of &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Self-propelled%20particle&quot;&gt;Self-propelled particle&lt;/a&gt; with a kind of asymmetry corresponding to half of the particle having one property, and the other a different one. Most often a Janus swimmer refers to spherical colloids, where one hemisphere is coated with some material, and the other with a different one (or just exposing the material of the colloid itself).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particular kind is the &lt;a class=&quot;tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves&quot; href=&quot;#Catalytic%20conductor-insulator%20Janus%20swimmer&quot;&gt;Catalytic conductor-insulator Janus swimmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
