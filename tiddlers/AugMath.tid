Automatic simplification is kept to a minimum, to allow notation tricks used in practice for manipulation. I the future, a setting for which level of auto simplification is desired should be added.


It's hard to practice defensive programming when you are trying to give users so much freedom.

It's interesting how having several different representations of the math (in the latex, the math tree, and the html), I think we can be more efficient by seizing the most appropiate one for each task (like checking some property)
