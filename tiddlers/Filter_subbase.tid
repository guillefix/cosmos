title: Filter subbase

[img[http://i.imgur.com/i0vZ63R.png]]

A filter subbase can generate a [[Filter base]], and like it, it can be extended so that a family of filter subbases (which we call ''subbase'') to generate a whole [[Topological space]].

Note that the sets forming the subbase are part of the base they generate, because finite intersections include the intersection of a set with itself.
