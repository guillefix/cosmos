title: Meet operation

A ''meet'', $$\wedge$$ is an [[operation|Operation (Mathematics)]] defined on elements of a [[poset|Partially ordered set]] $$P$$ (not necessarily all of them) defined as:

The join (or //[[Greatest lower bound]]//) of $$a, b \in P$$ is an element $$a \wedge b \in p$$ such that:

:(a) $$a \wedge b$$ is a //lower bound// of $$a$$ and $$b$$: thus $$a \wedge b$$  \preceq a and $$ a \vee b \preceq b$$;

:(b) $$a \wedge b$$ is the greatest such lower bound: i.e., if there exists $$c \in P$$ such that $$c \preceq a$$ and $$c \preceq b$$ then $$ c \preceq a \vee b$$.

Note that, if it exists, a join is necessarily unique.
