[[Graph coloring]] 

There appears to be a [[Phase transition]] w.r.t. to the average [[degree|Degree of a vertex (Graph theory)]] of the random graph, so that above a threshold, depending on the number of colors, the graph is not colorable [[w.h.p.|With high probability]], and below it, it is colorable w.h.p.

Can define annealed, and quenched entropy (which is more indicative)...

Can show that asymptotically for large number of colors $$q$$, the threshold is $$c_{col} \sim 2q\log{q}$$. A simple greedy coloring algorithm "works" (I guess polynomially in average?) for $$c < \frac{c_{col}}{2} \sim q\log{q}$$. [[However, noone has been able to show any other algorithm|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfB4Ucccws0&list=PL04QVxpjcnjhe-E7LfEZ3SOvXSodbPNgu&index=7#t=43m40s]] that would "work" for any larger $$c$$ for random graphs.

We can analyze them through [[Belief propagation]] ([[vid|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfB4Ucccws0&list=PL04QVxpjcnjhe-E7LfEZ3SOvXSodbPNgu&index=7#t=58m15s]]), aka [[Cavity method]]
