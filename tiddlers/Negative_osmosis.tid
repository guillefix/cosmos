When a flow of liquid occurs through a membrane from a more concentrated solution to a more dilute solution, it is designated as negative osmosis. Compare with (positive) [[Osmosis]]

See [[Physical mechanisms of osmosis]]

Many standard theoretical calculations of equilibrium osmotic pressure work under very ideal/simplifying assumptions; like the lattice model in Physical biology of the cell book.

Similarly treatments of osmotic flow are often simplified see for instance 
[[The solution-diffusion model: a review|http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037673889500102I]].

Real life application of osmotic flow need more complete descriptions, which include parameters, which are often measured, mainly the ''reflection coefficient''. Results can often differ (often just quantiatively) from more naive thermodynamic treatments.

When you try to find these parameters theoretically is when you get into the hard part, as a microscopic model is needed, whether based on kinetics, or hydrodynamics. This is where the richness of real-life phenomena comes to light.

Careful theoretical treatment has found negative reflection coefficients to be possible: [[MECHANISM OF OSMOTIC FLOW IN POROUS MEMBRANES|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1334591/pdf/biophysj00323-0049.pdf]], [[Diffusioosmosis of nonelectrolyte solutions in a fibrous medium|http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927775703001444]] However, I think they are only possible for non-perfectly-semipermeable membranes! See below. Actually Anderson's paper agrees! Note that in his figure 5, negative reflection coefficient is found only when the solute is smaller than the pore!

In the case of osmosis of electrolytes, there's more studies: [[Charge-Mosaic Membranes: Enhanced Permeability and Negative Osmosis with a Symmetrical Salt|http://science.sciencemag.org/content/161/3836/70]]

Although regular osmosis looks at semi-impermeable membranes, similar diffusio-osmotic effects can be studied for membranes where both solute and solvent can go through the pores:

[[Drastic alteration of diffusioosmosis due to steric effects|http://pubs.rsc.org/is/content/articlelanding/2015/cp/c5cp05327g#!divAbstract]]

[[Kinetics and thermodynamics across single-file pores: Solute permeability and rectified osmosis|http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/110/1/10.1063/1.478118]] (only find negative reflection coefficient (negative diffusion) when the membrane is permeable to solute as well).
