title: Test set bound
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Bounds which apply when testing on the [[Test set]] (aka hold out data) of some learning problem.

Under the usual assumptions of independence, they can be derived using [[Hoeffding's inequality]], or tighter versions of it based on analyzing the tails of the [[Binomial distribution]]
