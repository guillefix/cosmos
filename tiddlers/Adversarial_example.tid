[[Attacking Machine Learning with Adversarial Examples|https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/]]

[[Are Accuracy and Robustness Correlated?|https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04563]] We find that adversarial examples are mostly transferable across similar network topologies, and we demonstrate that better machine learning models are less vulnerable to adversarial examples.
