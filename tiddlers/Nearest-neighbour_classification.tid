title: Nearest-neighbour classification

Nearest-neighbor methods: To get the prediction Å¶ for a point $$x$$, use [those observations ($$k$$ of them) in the training set T, closest in input space to point x]. Remember training set is a set of pairs $$(x,y)$$. Closest often refers to Euclidean distance.

It turns out that the //effective number of parameters// of k-nearest neighbors is $$N/k$$, even if technically there is only one parameter, $$k$$.

 --> To me it seems more like a method in [[Nonparametric statistics]]! Indeed it is (see [[Wiki|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics#Non-parametric_models]]).
