 [[Using chaos to shadow the quadratic map for alltime|https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00207169808804740?needAccess=true]] --  We show that by introducing a small noise on the control
parameter a, we will be able to shadow a true orbit for all time. At each time
when the shadowing method fails (I think they refer to computaional methods developed by Hammel to determine if numerical orbit is shadowing a real one), we perturb a by fi and continue the
process. 

Chaotic processes are well known of its sensitive dependence on initial
conditions. So given a chaotic process, one can ask whether the orbit of this
chaotic process is a true orbit or not? The answer to this question depends
on many factors. One of these factors is the computer round off error which
is the main source of destroying the ability to correctly predict the true trajectories of these chaotic processes. Therefore, if two trajectories starting
with a distance equal to the computer round off error apart, then these two
trajectories will be more than one unit apart after just 50 iterates assuming
that the distance doubles on every iterate.
Since a great deal of research on chaotic processes relies heavily on
computer simulation [l-91 and since the study of the dynamics of these
chaotic processes involve thousands if not millions of iterate, one therefore
questions how much we see in the computer-generated pictures of chaotic
attractors is real and how much is due to the computer round off error.
Recent work has applied the idea of shadowing [lo- 121 and demonstrated
that some numerically generated chaotic orbits can be shadowed by
true orbits for long time periods.

For those chaotic processes that are not of this hyperbolic type, the
shadowing Lemma of Anosov and Bowen is no longer valid. Coven [17],
Nusse 1181 and Hammel [lo, 111 were able to show that for some nonlinear
maps and under some conditions true orbits can shadow numerical orbits.
