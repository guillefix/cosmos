//Algorithmic or computational complexity//

The ''computational complexity'' of an algorithm is an [[asymptotic|Asymptotic approximation]] estimate of how the algorithm's running time scales with the size of its input.

[[Pseudo-polynomial time|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-polynomial_time]]: if its running time is polynomial in the numeric value of the input, but is exponential in the length of the input â€“ the number of bits required to represent it. That is because numerical number $$n$$ is related to number of bits (digits in binary), $$b$$, by $$n=2^b$$.
