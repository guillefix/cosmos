In dynamical systems, complexity is usually measured by
the topological entropy and reflects roughly speaking, the proliferation of periodic
orbits with ever longer periods or the number of orbits that can be distinguished
with increasing precision.

[[Descriptional complexity]]

For a coarse-grained [[Dynamical system]], described by a transition graph, in turn described by an [[Adjacency matrix]] $$A$$, then the topological entropy $$h$$ is

$$h = \log{\lambda_{\text{max}}}$$

where $$\lambda_{\text{max}}$$ is the maximum eigenvalue of $$A$$ (assumed to be a positive matrix so that Perron-Frobenius applies).
