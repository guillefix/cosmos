A carbohydrate is a biological molecule consisting of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms.

In particular, we have one [[Hydroxyl]] groups (OH) attached to Carbons. These make carbohydrates [[Polar molecule]]s, and [[Hydrophobic]]

The term is most common in biochemistry, where it is a synonym of saccharide, a group that includes sugars, starch, and cellulose. The ''saccharides'' are divided into four chemical groups:

!!__Classification__

*[[Monosaccharide]]. Depending on the number of carbons, we call the sugar:  diose, triose, tetrose, pentose, hexose, heptose, octose, etc.
** [[Glucose]] (a cyclic sugar, very important one).
* [[Polysaccharide]]s. Several monosaccharides joined together by [[Dehydration synthesis]].
** disaccharides. Two monosaccharides
** [[Starch]]
** [[Cellulose]]
** [[Glycogen]]
* oligosaccharides,
