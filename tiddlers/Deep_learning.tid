Deep learning [[Machine learning]] in a modular way using ''layers'', like in [[Torch|Torch (Deep learning framework)]]. [[Artificial neural network]]s, with many layers..

The idea is also that layers are //recursive//, i.e. layers can be made up of layers.

!!!__[[Multi-instance learning]]__

good for generalizing models, ''transfer learning'', ''multi-task learning''. Good when don't have much supervision data.

!!!__[[Neural networks with memory]]__

''Memory'' is good for recognizing time sequence data. See [[Long short-term memory]].
