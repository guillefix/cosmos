number of vertices - number of edges + number of faces

This is called ''Euler's formula''

[ext[Intro|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB6wZFzscOY#t=56m25s]], relating it to the  [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]] 

It is a [[Topological invariant]].

For a [[CW complex]], it is defined as the number of even-dimensional cells minus the number of odd-dimensional cells. the Euler characteristic of a cell complex depends only on its homotopy type, so the fact that the house with two rooms (from Hatcher) has the homotopy type of a point implies that its Euler characteristic must be 1, no matter how it is represented as a cell complex.

is since m S 1 has Euler characteristic 1âˆ’m . But it
is a rather nontrivial theorem that the Euler characteristic of a space depends only on
its [[Homotopy]] type

!!__Euler's formula for triangle meshes__

Each edge is adjacent to two faces.  Each face has three edges. Think of half-edges, etc. For a closed surface, every face has 3 half-edges, so it has 3/2 edges, so $$2E = 3F$$. Often $$E, F, V \gg \chi$$, so that we can use Euler's formula to find that $$F \approx 2V$$, and $$E \approx 3V$$. Average valence of a vertex $$\approx 3$$
