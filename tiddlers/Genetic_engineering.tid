[[Gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuAxDVBt7kQ]] Cas9 refers to a protein that has been found in bacteria inmune systems that is able to cut a DNA double strand at a point which matches the sequence of an RNA chimera (i.e. a molecule made of several RNA parts). This allows the programmable cutting of DNA. It is a particular type of a [[restriction enzime|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme]], which are enzymes which cut DNA at certain sites.

This is important for genetic engineering because it is known that when you cut DNA, one way DNA repairs is by rejoining the two ends of the cut by introducing a new piece of DNA.
