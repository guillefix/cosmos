Any generalization of [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], where an integer index is used in two different ways, so that either one shows that an indexed list of a set is impossible (showing the set is uncountable), or one shows that there are elements that one can construct but don't belong to the set. See [[GEB|Godel, Escher, Bach]]
