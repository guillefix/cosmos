One of the most studied model organisms is the [[Escherichia coli|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli]]

[[Gram staining|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_staining]] is a method of staining used to differentiate bacterial species into two large groups (''gram-positive'' and ''gram-negative''), by detecting [[peptidoglycan|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptidoglycan]], which is present in a thick layer in gram-positive bacteria

[[Actinobacteria|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria]] is a phylum of Gram-positive bacteria with high guanine and cytosine content in their DNA

[[Streptomyces|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces]] is the largest genus of Actinobacteria

[[Streptomyces hygroscopicus|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces_hygroscopicus]] produces [[Sirolimus|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus]], also known as rapamycin which is an inhibitor of the [[Kinase]] enzyme [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin]]
