!![[Coding theory]]

A code is a representation of information/data. 

Coding theory (and/or coding methods) is the study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a specific application. These applications include [[Data transmission]], [[Data compression]], [[Cryptography]], and [[Network information theory]]

!![[Data transmission]]

See [[Source-channel separation theorem]]

The main problem of study in data transmission theory is: for a particular [[Communication channel]], find code so that data transmission rate is as high as possible, while receiver receives the information with negligible probability of error.

The limit in data transmission rate turns out to be the [[Channel capacity]], as established by the [[Channel coding theorem]].

Data transmission is part of the broader area of study called [[Communication theory]], which includes consideration of the information source and destination.

!! [[Data compression]]

Study of theoretical limits and implementation of codes that make average length of the value of a random variable as short as possible, whether in a lossless, or lossy way.

The limit in the average length of codewords in a lossless code turns out to be the entropy, as established  by the [[Source coding theorem]]

Limits in lossy codes are established in [[Rate compression theory]]

!![[Cryptography]]

!![[Network information theory]]

!![[Algorithmic information theory]]

''[[Kolmogorov complexity]]''. Shortest program that will produced desired output in Turing machine. Occam's razor
