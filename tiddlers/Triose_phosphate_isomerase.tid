title: Triose phosphate isomerase
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

An [[Enzyme]] that helps [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] become [[Dihydroxy acetone phosphate]].

See video from edx course.

It is a diffusion-limited enzyme (the rate-limiting step in the reaction is [[Diffusion]] itself). This is also called kinetically perfect. There is no point in [[Evolution]] to make it any faster, as it's not rate-limiting.
