!!!__Tuning transcription, translation degradation__

Tune [[Gene expression]]: [[DNA transcription]], [[mRNA translation]].

* ''Tuning transcription'':
** Tune promoter regions. Operator and activator sequences.
** transcription factors, inducers to tune the activity of the promoter region.

* ''Tuning translation'':
** Tune RBS (see [[mRNA translation]]). Translation regulated by changing mRNA secondary structure.
** Tune codon usage. Some codons, that give rise to the same amino acid may result in more efficient translation. Due to abundance of [[tRNA]] (be careful with comptetition for the same tRNA, which can change their availability), change in secondary structure. There can be problems with [[Protein folding]], as protein folding can depend on translation speed. [[RNA stability]]

* ''Tuning [[Protein degradation]]''. Use tags that label proteins for faster degradation. 

''Reporter''s.

* $$\beta$$-galactosidase (encoded by lacZ)
* $$\beta$$-glucoronidase. Similar. (GUS)
* Luciferase, luciferin
** Bacterial luciferase
** [[Green fluorescent protein]]. Many colours obtained by [[Artificial selection]].
