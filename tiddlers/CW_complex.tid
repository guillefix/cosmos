If $$X=X^n$$ for some $$n$$ then $$X$$ is finite dimensional and the smallest such $$n$$ is its dimension.

For a finite dimensional cell complex, we can define the [[Euler characteristic]]. the Euler characteristic of a cell complex depends only on its homotopy type, so the fact that the house with two rooms (from Hatcher) has the homotopy type of a point implies that its Euler characteristic must be 1, no matter how it is represented as a cell complex.

Each cell e Î± in a cell n complex X has a characteristic map $$\Phi_\alpha:: D_\alpha^n \to X$$ which extends the attaching map $$\phi_\alpha$$ and is a [[Homeomorphism]] from the [[interior|Interior of a set]] of $$D_\alpha^n$$ onto $$e_\alpha^n$$ . Namely, we can take $$\Phi_\alpha^n$$ to be the composition $$D^n_\alpha \hookrightarrow X^{n-1}\amalg_\alpha D_\alpha^n \to X^n \hookrightarrow X$$ where the middle map is the [[quotient map|Canonical projection]] defining $$X^n$$

So note that an [[n-cell]] is the [[interior|Interior of a set]] of an n-[[Disk]] (see [[this video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLHcRp1S2MM&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E&t=383]]). The characteristic and attachment maps are defined on the disk corresponding to each n-cell.

A subcomplex is a closed subspace that is the union of cells in $$X$$. A pair (X, A) consisting of a
cell complex X and a subcomplex A will be called a CW pair. For example, each skeleton X n of a cell complex X is a subcomplex.
