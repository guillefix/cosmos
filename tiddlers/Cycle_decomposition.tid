[[Definition|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSU2uYDL0Bc&index=5&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS#t=56m]]

See [[Symmetric group]]

An important special case is a [[cycle|Cyclic permutation]]. [[All disjoint cycles commute|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSU2uYDL0Bc&index=5&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS#t=50m10s]] ([[disjoint refers to the fact that they cycle different elements|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSU2uYDL0Bc&index=5&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS#t=48m55s]]).  ''Theorem'':
 [[All elements in the symmetric group can be written as a product of disjoint cycles|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSU2uYDL0Bc&index=5&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS#t=52m20s]]. If the union of the supports of the cycles equals the $$\{1...n\}$$, the decomposition is unique and we call it the [[Cycle decomposition]]

[[Proof|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSU2uYDL0Bc&index=5&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS#t=1h10s]] The support of the [[cycles|Cyclic permutation]] in the cycle decompositoin of permutation $$\sigma$$ are the [[Group orbit]]s generated by $$\sigma$$ acting on the elements of $$\{1...n\}$$ (where the group action is just by interpreting $$\sigma$$ as a bijection). Corollary: every element in symmetric group can be written as a product of [[Transposition]]s, [[because any cycle is a product of transpositions|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSU2uYDL0Bc&index=5&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS#t=1h22m]].

The [[Conjugacy class]] of an element in symmetric group is determined by the length of the cycles in the cycle decomposition. [[So there is a 1-1 correspondence between conjugacy classes and paritions of the set [n]|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt-H7tVBqAY&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS&index=6#t=3m40s]]. 

[[Lemma|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt-H7tVBqAY&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS&index=6#t=13m40s]]. Two permutations are conjugated if and only if they have the same type.

[[Corollary|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt-H7tVBqAY&list=PLLq_gUfXAnknLXjNSnKKLT4LI1AfTy9PS&index=6#t=27m20s]]. The number of conjugacy classes of S_n is equal to the number of partitions of [n], which is $$2^n$$.
