''[[Artificial intelligence]]'' (''AI'') has the overall goal of understanding and engineering //intelligence//, behaviour that involves understanding, and higher [[cognitive|Cognitive science]] functions. It is a broad and very interdisciplinary field. It feeds to and from [[Machine learning]], [[Logic]], [[Cognitive science]], [[Neuroscience]], etc.

''Machine intelligence'', is essentially a synonym of AI, but with the connotation of using machines and computers to create and understand intelligence. The biggest part of it, [[Machine learning]], deals with the problem of __learning a model__ from data so as to solve (mostly) __predictive__ tasks.

Why Deep Learning models perform so well?

Seems to be a result of:

*Very large datasets
*Increasing computing power
*Flexibility of the models. Lots of parameters when lots of layers. Furthermore multiple layers avoide the curse of dimensionality
