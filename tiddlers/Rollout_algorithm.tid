[[Decision-time planning]] where the value of possible actions is estimated by [[Monte Carlo]] sampling of future trajectories, for each of which we compute the cumulative reward (see [[Reinforcement learning]]), and averaging. We then often choose the most rewarding action (but with some probability we may not [[to allow some exploration|Exploration-exploitation trade-off]].
