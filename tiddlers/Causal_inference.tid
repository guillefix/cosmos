[[ML beyond Curve Fitting: An Intro to Causal Inference and do-Calculus|http://www.inference.vc/untitled/]]. you can attempt to perform full causal discovery: attempting to infer the causal model or at least aspects of it, from empirical data.

But the bottom line is: a full causal model is a form of prior knowledge that you have to add to your analysis in order to get answers to causal questions without actually carrying out interventions.Â
