title: Moments of power laws

As can be shown again by approximating sum by integral, all the moments $$\langle k^m \rangle$$of a power law distribution diverge for $$m>\alpha-1$$. Of course, this is in the limit of an infinite system with the same distribution, in finite systems (as in networks with a finite number of nodes), the moment will of course be finite (for a network, $$k$$ will have a maximum value, cutting off the domain of the integral used to calculate $$C$$).
