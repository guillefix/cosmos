title: Features of evolving systems

Some features that are important in the behaviour of an [[evolving|Evolution]] system.

//Important features//:

* ''Evolvability'' ([[wiki page|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolvability]]). May be defined as "the capacity of a system for adaptive evolution"; however, this is often called ''adaptability'' (I think). Evolvability is then defined just as "the number of other phenotypes //potentially// accessible from a phenotype" (see [[this paper|http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/95/20140249]] or [[Robustness and evolvability: a paradox resolved|http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1630/91]])

* ''Modularity''. See [[Self-assembly, modularity, and physical complexity|http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.82.026117]], and ''complexity''. [[Homologues, Natural Kinds and the Evolution of Modularity|http://az.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/1/36.abstract]]

*''Robustness''. See [[Mutational robustness]]. [[Environmental robustness|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLYpjUANUdc&feature=youtu.be#t=4m40s]]. There are genotypic and phenotypic robustness. See [[Common features of GP maps]]
