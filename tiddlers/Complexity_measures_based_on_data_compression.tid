title: Complexity measures based on data compression

See [[Descriptional complexity]], [[Data compression]]

Some measures of descriptional complexity are based on [[Data compression]] techniques, like the [[Lempel-Ziv complexity]].

__Relations to [[Grammar-based compression]]s used in [[Data compression]]__

[[Application of Lempelâ€“Ziv factorization to the approximation of grammar-based compression |http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~stelo/papers/extra/rytter2.pdf]] Relations between LZ-factorizations and grammar-based factorizations (G-factorization). The G-factorization gives an upper bound for the LZ complexity.
