!!__Transcription initiation__

Initiator sequence

Many factors.... Helps with helicase activity. [[phosphorelates|Phosphorelation]] the enzyme (activates it)

* TFIIH

* [[Transcription factor]]s

!!__Transcription elongation__

* Capping the pre-mRNA. The cap binding complex is recognized by nuclear pores to let the completed mRNA out of the nucleus.
* Polyadenylating the pre-mRNA, like telomeres for mRNA... determines its half-life.

!!!__RNA polymerase__

__Eukaryotes__

* [[RNA polymerase]]
** Pol I makes [[Ribosomal RNA]]
** Pol II makes [[Messenger RNA]]
** Pol II makes [[Transfer RNA]]
** Pol IV and V, only in [[Plant cell]]s

__[[Prokaryote]]s__

Only one type of DNA

__Function__

*First unwinds the [[DNA]] (helicase activity)

* Transcribes 3' to 5' end to create a 5' to 3; precursor mRNA strand

* DNA/RNA hybrid is separated at an archway.

!!!__Pre-mRNA processing - splicing__

One [[Gene]] that can code for multiple variants of the [[Protein]]. 

* [[Exon]]s, and [[Intron]]s

* snRNA

* splicesome. See video RNA splicing mechanism.

!!__mRNA stability__

* Half-lives around 30min to 10 hours.

!!__Transcription in bacteria__

Much simpler. transcription, and translations coupled. Can code several proteins at the same time, operon.
