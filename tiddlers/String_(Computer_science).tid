A ''string'', in [[Computer science]], [[Information theory]], and [[Mathematics]], is a [[Sequence]] of symbols, where each symbol is a member of a given set, called the alphabet. Strings often refer to finite sequences. See [[here|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjWHh1mAUsQ]].

These constructions are useful in [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer science]].

__Strings in computer science__

In computer science, strings are one of the fundamental [[Data type]]s used in [[Programming]]. In this case, the symbols are called ''characters''.

However, a string can also be considered as a [[Data structure]]
