''Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean'' is a hierarchical agglomerative [[Clustering]] method, which means that one starts with the objects in separate clusters, and gradually merges these, depending on the distance between them, to form clusters. A distance cutoff has to be applied that determines when the program should stop forming clusters; i.e. once the distance between clusters is over a certain value, tehn no more merging should occur
