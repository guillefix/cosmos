The theory of Knowledge. 

[[Introduction to Epistemology|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3IcbRNQR4c]]

-----------------------

What is the nature of knowledge?

What are the obstacles to the attainment of knowledge?

What can be known?

How does knowledge differ from opinion or belief?

!![[Foundationalism|https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Foundationalism]] vs [[Coherentism|https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Coherentism]] 

[w]hat distinguishes a coherence theory is simply the claim that nothing can count as a reason for a belief except another belief‚Äù (Davidson, 1986)

An advocate of //weak foundationalism// typically holds that while coherence is incapable of justifying beliefs from scratch, it can provide justification for beliefs that already have some initial, perhaps miniscule, degree of warrant, e.g., for observational beliefs.

I would extend the coherentism picture with what I call the ''Principle of inclusiveness''.
