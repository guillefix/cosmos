title: Dropout
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A [[Regularization]] method for [[deep|Deep learning]] [[neural networks|Artificial neural network]], which works by dropping out random neurons/nodes in the network, while training. This avoids [[overfitting|Overfitting and underfitting]] by forcing the network to learn more robust models, that tend to be simpler.
