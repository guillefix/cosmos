Used in [[Biochemistry]]

a decrease of solvency
of non-polar species in polar solvents upon addition of salts.

This effect is widely used in biochemistry for precipitation, separation  and  coagulation  of  biomolecules  from  their
aqueous solutions.

The salting-out effect results from the formation of ion (specially anion)â€“water hydration complexes, which, in turn, decreases hydration, and hence, the solubility of the polymer and the salting-in effect results from a direct binding of the cations to the ether oxygens of the polymers.
