$$H=U + pV$$

!!!__Enthalpy change under constant pressure__

For processes under constant pressure, Î”H is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the pressure-volume work that the system has done on its surroundings.[3] This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed (or released) by the material through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer.
