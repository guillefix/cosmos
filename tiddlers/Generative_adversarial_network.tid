An architecture to train generative neural networks, i.e. [[neural networks|Artificial neural network]] which act as [[Generative model]]s, i.e. their inputs are [[Latent variable]]s, and their output is the observed data.

!!__Adversarial networks__

The way the network is trained is by having the generative network produce images, while training a different discriminative network to discriminate between real and generated images. In this way, the discriminative network can be used as a very good cost function, which penalized generated images which are distinguishably different from the real images that the generative network is train to model.

We are in effect learning the cost function

!!__Trining GANs__

[[Trained|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPkb5VcgXAM#t=18m05]] via [[Gradient descent]] and [[Backpropagation]]

I think that the discriminator needs to have a separate cost function which measures the number of images the discriminator missclassified as being real or generated. [[Discriminator is optimized to not be fooled by the generator|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPkb5VcgXAM#t=19m47]]

On the other hand, the generative network uses the discriminative network as cost. [[Generator to fool discriminator, i.e. it is trained to maximize the mistakes the the discriminator does|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPkb5VcgXAM#t=19m20]], that's why they are called ''adversarial''

The discriminator is //teaching// the generator, and it's adapting to the generator's knowledge and flaws. //Machine teaching//, not just machine learning.

!!__Theoretical properties__

If you have an optimal discriminator, the generator minimizes the [[Jensen-Shanon divergence]]

They are similar to [[Autoencoder]]s but we learn the cost function, instead of just using l2 loss  ([[vid|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPkb5VcgXAM#t=58m50]])
