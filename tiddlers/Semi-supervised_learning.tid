A type of [[Machine learning]] problem where only some of the labels ('outputs') are available in the training data, the rest of the training data being just 'inputs'.

[[Generative model]]s are often used for [[Feature learning]] from the whole input data set, and then using the learned features, a model can be trained with the few labelled samples. See for instance, [[Generative adversarial network]]s

--------------

I think, [[Generative supervised learning]] is sometimes used in the labelled part, and the rest of the trained data is used to train the [[Generative model]] of the inputs, using techniques from [[Unsupervised learning]]. The latent variables may be seen as predicted outputs for the unlabeled inputs.
