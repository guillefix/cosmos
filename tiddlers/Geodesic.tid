The [[Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations]] of motion for the functional E are then given in local coordinates by

can compute wavefront using [[Eikonal equation]]

[[A curve is a geodesic iff its acceleration is normal to the surface S at every point|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4fLmI0MlnU#t=1h4m]], that is its velocity doesn't change in the tangent plane, at every point! (it's locally straight when projected to the surface).

> You can think of geodesics as the trajectories that a little frictionless ball would follow in a "hollow" surface, where the only forces acting on it are the [[Normal force]]s due to the walls of the hollow surface

[[Geodesics are preserved|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4fLmI0MlnU#t=1h2m30s]] under [[Isometry]]es

[[Solution to geodesic given point and tangent vector exists and is unique|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AgvKLtcijQ#t=3m45s]], [[at least locally|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AgvKLtcijQ#t=14m]], and it also depends smoothly on these initial conditions.

__Examples__

[[Geodesics on the plane|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AgvKLtcijQ#t=12m6s]], are [[Line]]s

[[Geodesics on |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AgvKLtcijQ#t=16m30s]][[Surface of revolution]]s. [[Meridian]]s [[are geodesics|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AgvKLtcijQ#t=27m6s]]. [[Parallel (surface of revolution)]] [[are geodesics when they intersect a meridian at a critical point (vertically)|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AgvKLtcijQ#t=33m55s]]

[[Geodesics on the |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AgvKLtcijQ#t=42m33s]][[Sphere]] are [[Maximal circle]]s
