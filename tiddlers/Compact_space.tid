title: Compact space

A [[Topological space]] $$X$$ is //compact// if every [[Filter base]] $$\mathcal{B}$$ on $$X$$ has an accumulation point. That is, there exists $$x \in X$$ such that

for all $$N \in \mathcal{N}(x)$$, for all $$A \in \mathcal{B}$$, $$N \cap A \neq \emptyset$$.

An alternative, well-known definition involves properties of ‘coverings’ of X by families of open sets.
