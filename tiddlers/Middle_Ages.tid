__[[The Church]] as a [[power|Power (sociology)]]__.  A democratic organization where intellectuals could work (although with increasing conflicts with politics and faith). It was a structure that help in keeping civilization alive during the middle ages, and provided the spirit of the times, spiritually and in action: the building of the churches and cathedrals, pilgrimages.

<small>[[Where some way of thought or human activity is really vital to us, then internationalism is accepted unhesitatingly|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDm4Sl6CdYU&list=PLkq44i-E582zDNKD8MqnSzRzRz7D9A-fV#t=5m]] (then, in the church, now in [[Science]]).</small>

However, as tends to happen with big powers, those who threaten the power, are in danger. People who promoted doubt and questioning like the eminent [[Peter Abelard|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Abelard]], who in 1122, said "The beginning of wisdom is found in doubting; by doubting we come to questioning, and by questioning we perceive the truth."

[[First great church|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDm4Sl6CdYU&list=PLkq44i-E582zDNKD8MqnSzRzRz7D9A-fV#t=7m]], where the monastic tradition began was the [[Abbey of Cluney|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluny_Abbey]], the biggest church at the time (but of which most has been lost, including its magnificient ornaments)

[[Romanesque]] -- Mixture of styles from Northern invaders, and imports of Eastern origin, from the [[Crusades]] and [[Pilgrimage]]s to Jersualem. [[Cluniac ornaments were full of baroque energy, fiercely Tibetan|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDm4Sl6CdYU&list=PLkq44i-E582zDNKD8MqnSzRzRz7D9A-fV#t=10m10s]],
 around the order of the church there was a lot of curiosity, (though Puritans, like the founder of the Cister order, were against a lot of that. [[and it's there that the spirit of monasticism has survived today|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDm4Sl6CdYU&list=PLkq44i-E582zDNKD8MqnSzRzRz7D9A-fV#t=12m30s]])

[[Relics were very important|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDm4Sl6CdYU&list=PLkq44i-E582zDNKD8MqnSzRzRz7D9A-fV#t=17m36s]], like the [[Abbey church dedicated to Saint Foy|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDm4Sl6CdYU&list=PLkq44i-E582zDNKD8MqnSzRzRz7D9A-fV#t=18m]]
