//aka trait//

A trait is a general aspect of physiology being shown in a [[Phenotype]]. So, for example, the trait being discussed in [[here|https://www.stat.washington.edu/thompson/Genetics/1.3_genotypes.html]] is the flower-color of the pea plant. The phenotype can be either red or white flower color, depending on the genotype.
