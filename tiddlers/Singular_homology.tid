See [ext[book|https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf#page=117]] for definition, etc.

We define a [[Singular simplex]], their corresponding [[Chain group]], the [[Boundary map]]s between them, and the [[Singular homology group]] as the [[quotient|Quotient group]] of the kernel of the outgoing map by the image of the incoming map.

[[Proposition|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE9NqVYUKew&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E&index=20#t=2m]]. If you decompose the space into [[Path-connected]] components, then the homology group of the space is the [[Direct sum]] of the homology groups of the components.

[[Proposition|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE9NqVYUKew&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E&index=20#t=5m15s]] If $$X$$ is non-emtpy and path connected, then the zeroth homology group $$H_0(X) = \mathbb{Z}$$ (the [[Ring]] of [[Integer]]s). Hence for any space $$X$$, $$H_0(X) = \bigoplus \mathbb{Z}$$ (direct sum of $$\mathbb{Z}$$s, one for each path-connected component). That is, for a path-connected space, all points are homologic (as they are the boundary of a path), and so the homology group is the free abelian group generated by a single generator (the homology class of any point), which is isomorphic to $$\mathbb{Z}$$.

[[Prop 2.8|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIJ1aoMpRR4&index=21&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E]]. If $$X$$ is a point, then $$H_n(X)=0$$ for $$n>0$$ and $$H_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$$.

It is often very convenient to have a slightly modified version of homology for which a point has trivial homology groups in all dimensions, including zero. This is e n (X) to be the homology groups done by defining the [[Reduced homology group]]s

See also [ext[Hatcher|https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf#page=119]]. We define a [[Functor]] by finding an induced function $$f_\#$$ between [[Chain group]]s which is a [[Group homomorphism]], which itself induces a function $$f_*$$ between [[Homology group]]s by lifting $$f_\#$$ to the [[Coset]]s defining the homology groups, and showing it's well defined because it maps cycles to cycles and boundaries to boundaries. Finally, there is a theorem that shows that homotopic maps lead to equal $$f_*$$, from which one can conclude (after showing [[Functorial]]ity) that homotopy equivalences induce group isomorphisms between the homology groups.
