[[Definition|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4M7qJK2ShQ#t=36m20s]]. For a [[Topological space]] $$X$$, we consider the set of all [[Singular simplex]]es, the corresponding [[Chain group]], the [[Boundary map]]s ([[vid|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4M7qJK2ShQ#t=51m10s]]) between them, giving rise to a [[Chain complex]] (called [[Singular chain complex|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4M7qJK2ShQ#t=37m55s]]). Then ''singular homology'' is defined as the [[Singular homology group]]s, which are the [[quotient|Quotient group]] of the kernel of the outgoing map by the image of the incoming map (that is the [[Homology group]]s).

Note that the set of singular simplices (continuous functions from simplex to space) is most often uncountably [[Infinite]], and so the Chain groups are also infinite. However, the quotient groups defining the singular homology turn out to be finite. (see [[here|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4M7qJK2ShQ#t=1h11m50s]]).

 If we have a [[Continuous function]] between topological spaces, this gives us a [[Group homomorphism]] between the corresponding homology groups. This will mean that Homology is a [[Topological invariant]], and so can be used to study if two spaces are [[homeomorphic|Homeomorphism]].

[[Formal definition|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4M7qJK2ShQ#t=1h16m29s]] of induced [[Chain map]] $$f_\#$$, defined as 
[[the pushforward of singular simplex|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4M7qJK2ShQ#t=1h28m20s]], [[and extending linearly|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyWebCsTVGI&index=7&list=PLLq_gUfXAnkkdRttylq7Svmob1gxDgcDZ#t=8m]], and it is easy to check directly that it commutes with boundary map (by using its definition), so it is indeed a chain map.

This chain map [[induces a map on homology|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4M7qJK2ShQ#t=1h20m35s]] (see below also), [[defined by lifting f_* to the homology classes|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyWebCsTVGI&index=7&list=PLLq_gUfXAnkkdRttylq7Svmob1gxDgcDZ#t=10m40s]], and it is called the ''pushforward'' by $$f$$.

[[Video1|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIJ1aoMpRR4&index=21&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E#t=7m]]/[[Video2|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1ljIoXKAzE&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E&index=22]] [[Homotopy equivalent]] spaces have [[isomorphic|Group isomorphism]] [[Homology group]]s. See also [ext[Hatcher|https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf#page=119]]. We define a [[Functor]] by finding an induced function $$f_\#$$ between [[Chain group]]s which is a [[Group homomorphism]], which itself induces a function $$f_*$$ between [[Homology group]]s by lifting $$f_\#$$ to the [[Coset]]s defining the homology groups, and showing it's well defined because it maps cycles to cycles and boundaries to boundaries. Finally, there is a theorem that shows that homotopic maps lead to equal $$f_*$$, from which one can conclude (after showing [[Functorial]]ity) that homotopy equivalences induce group isomorphisms between the homology groups.

-------------------

[[Proposition|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE9NqVYUKew&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E&index=20#t=2m]]. If you decompose the space into [[Path-connected]] components, then the homology group of the space is the [[Direct sum]] of the homology groups of the components.

[[Proposition|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE9NqVYUKew&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E&index=20#t=5m15s]] If $$X$$ is non-emtpy and path connected, then the zeroth homology group $$H_0(X) = \mathbb{Z}$$ (the [[Ring]] of [[Integer]]s). Hence for any space $$X$$, $$H_0(X) = \bigoplus \mathbb{Z}$$ (direct sum of $$\mathbb{Z}$$s, one for each path-connected component). That is, for a path-connected space, all points are homologic (as they are the boundary of a path), and so the homology group is the free abelian group generated by a single generator (the homology class of any point), which is isomorphic to $$\mathbb{Z}$$.

[[Prop 2.8|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIJ1aoMpRR4&index=21&list=PL7BFF10190F42006E]]. If $$X$$ is a point, then $$H_n(X)=0$$ for $$n>0$$ and $$H_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$$.

It is often very convenient to have a slightly modified version of homology for which a point has trivial homology groups in all dimensions, including zero. This is e n (X) to be the homology groups done by defining the [[Reduced homology group]]s
