title: Unified atomic mass unit
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Symbol: $$u$$.

Non-SI unit of mass (equal to the atomic mass constant), defined as one twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom in its ground state and used to express masses of atomic particles, $$ u \approx 1.6605402 10 \times 10^{-27} \text{kg}$$

By the definition of [[Avogadro's constant]], $$A$$, (see [[Mole]]), 

$$u = \frac{1\text{ gram}}{A}$$
