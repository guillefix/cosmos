//also called metric or measure-theoretical entropy//

[[Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy|http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Kolmogorov-Sinai_entropy]]

See the related [[Topological entropy]]

For a [[Measure-theoretical dynamical system]], the metric entropy of the system with respect to a partition $$\alpha$$ is defined to be the [[Entropy rate]] of the [[stochastic process|Stochastic processes]] resulting from the partition.

The metric entropy (aka (Kolmogorovâ€“Sinai or measure-theoretical) is then the supremum of {the metric entropy with respect to $$\alpha$$} over all finite partitions $$\alpha$$.

Metric entropy provides
the maximum average information per unit of time obtainable per unit of time, from the dynamical system.

See Amigo's book for details. He also gives a good example with the tent map.

Note his notation $$\vee$$ refers to the [[join|https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Join_and_meet]] of two sigma-algebras. See [[here|https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Join_(sigma_algebra)]]
