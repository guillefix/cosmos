"The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a
room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be
fatal. With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked."
~Ivan Sutherland, 1965
Early prediction of programmable matter, what a nice gem
