Oculus
Introducing DeepFocus: The AI Rendering System Powering Half Dome
Facebook Reality Labs has built DeepFocus, a new AI-powered framework for rendering natural, realistic focus effects in real time.

Guillermo
Why is it so difficult to render blur in real time?
What a re multifocal and light field displays?
Guillermo Valle
Why is it so difficult to render blur in real time?
Corner cases and artifacts. Like when there is blur from an object which is just occluded
In which case we get only a bit of light from the Gaussian blob as some of the light rays are occluded
It's easy to  see this could get quite computationally intensive

"The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a
room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be
fatal. With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked."
~Ivan Sutherland, 1965
Early prediction of programmable matter, what a nice gem
