An architecture of a [[Polymer]] material, where the polymer molecules are cross-linked in a [[Network]].

__Elasticity__

[[predictive theory of elasticity in a polymer network|http://phys.org/news/2016-09-theory-longstanding-polymer-problem.html]] -- [[video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omEKWZLRvAo]]

These chains form networks in which each chain would ideally bind to only one other chain. However, in real-life materials, a significant fraction of these chains bind to themselves, forming defectsâ€”floppy loops that weaken the network.
These loops also make it impossible to accurately calculate the material's elasticity, because existing formulas for this calculation assume that the material has no defects.

The new method, __network disassembly spectrometry__ allowed them to measure the number of loops, and see its effect on [[Elasticity]].  They also developed a new theory, as previous models didn't predict what they measured. The theory is based on the [[Phantom network theory]] ([[vid|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omEKWZLRvAo#t=1m43s]])
