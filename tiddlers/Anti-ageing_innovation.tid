PREVENT . RESTORE . PRESERVE

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
— Dylan Thomas

 two of her own company’s experimental gene therapies:

*one to protect against loss of muscle mass with age,

*another to battle stem cell depletion responsible for diverse age-related diseases and infirmities.

[[Telomere]]s are short segments of DNA which cap the ends of every chromosome, acting as ‘buffers’ against wear and tear.  They shorten with every cell division, eventually getting too short to protect the chromosome, causing the cell to malfunction and the body to age.

“Current therapeutics offer only marginal benefits for people suffering from diseases of aging. Additionally, lifestyle modification has limited impact for treating these diseases. Advances in biotechnology is the best solution, and if these results are anywhere near accurate, we’ve made history”

Note: this is awesome

It remains to be seen whether the success in leukocytes can expanded to other tissues and organs, and repeated in future patients

What would you say if I told you that aging happens not because of accumulation of stresses, but rather because of the intrinsic properties of the gene network of the organism? I’m guessing you’d be like: :o .

.......

* Telomerase gene therapy.
* * To avoid stem cell depletion (as it controls how many times a cell can divide)
** Remethylates genes. As we grow old, more genes are activated, eventually causing cancer. We want to disactivate them
* Muscle mass. Myostatin inhibition, AAV Follistan
* CRISPR - many genes could be targeted.

------------------

* Parabiosis. blood borne factors in young blood can rejuvenate old mice. Human trial going on now. Both positive factors from young mouse, and negative factors being cleared

* Senecent cell removal. Liposomal targeting, gene therapy
* Glycation. AGE breakers
* Mitochondria.
