title: Physical mechanisms of osmosis

[[Physical|Physics]] mechanisms of [[Osmosis]]

!!__Macroscopic/thermodynamic description__

Based on [[Chemical potential]]s, [[Solution (Chemistry)]]

!!__Microscopic mechanism__

[[MECHANISM OF OSMOTIC FLOW IN POROUS MEMBRANES|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1334591/pdf/biophysj00323-0049.pdf]]

The standard chemical potential explanation still holds as part of the mechanism. See [[here|http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/212183/physic-explanation-to-osmosis?rq=1]]. The energy comes from the expansion of the solute (which works like an ideal gas), just like in [[quasistatic adiabatic expansion|https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/work-done-in-adiabatic-quasistatic-compression.138448/]].

However, the boundary layer given by a [[Diffusio-osmotic|Diffusio-osmosis]] effect, enhances the checmical potential difference at the pore increasing the osmotic pressure. The extra work done in the process, I think, ultimately comes from the fact that the potential energy near the wall is lowered as the solute concentration decreases during the process.

When membrane is semi-permeable (as in [[Osmosis]] proper), then I think that the main effect would be an excluded volume effect (this appears to be indeed the case, at least for purely semi-impermeable membranes see [[Negative osmosis]]), giving rise to an effective repulsive potential, like that in Nelson's Biological physics book, or those that appear in [[Diffusio-osmosis]], or [[Diffusiophoresis]].

The mechanism is based on the wall repelling the solute molecules. See analysis [[here|http://nature.berkeley.edu/osterlab/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Osmosis.pdf]].
