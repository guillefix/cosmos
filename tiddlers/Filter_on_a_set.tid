A ''filter'' $$\mathcal{F}$$ on $$X$$ is a family of subsets of $$X$$ such that:

(a) $$\emptyset \notin \mathcal{F}$$;

(b) $$\mathcal{F}$$ is algebraically closed under finite intersections;

(c) $$\mathcal{F}$$ is an upper family.

An //upper family// refers to a family of subsets, which is an [[Upper set]] w.r.t. the [[Lattice of subsets]] of $$X$$, that is if a set is in the family, then any subset of that set is also in the family.
