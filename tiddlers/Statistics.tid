''Statistics'' is concerned with the study of collective properties of collections of objects (refered to as [[Population]]s). One can model properties of this set (like [[Frequency distribution]]s) as [[Probability distribution]]s, even though these don't have the interpretation of probabilities, as there isn't any randomness. Any quantity intended to summarize properties of the population may be called a //statistic//

!!__[[Statistical inference]]__

For reasons of time or cost we may not wish or be able to study each individual element of the population. In statistical //inference// <small>(probably the main area of study in statistics)</small>, the object is to draw conclusions ("infer") about the unknown population characteristics on the basis of information on some characteristics of a suitably selected sample.

The combination of a population with a random [[Sampling]] procedure, defines [[Random variable]]s known as [[Sample]]s, and allows for a more mathematically-principled application of [[Probability]] ([[Probability theory]]). Functions of these samples are also known as [[Statistic]]s.

General approaches:

* [[Bayesian inference]] ([[Bayesian statistics]], [[Credible interval]]s)
* [[Frequentist inference]] ([[Frequentist statistics]], [[Confidence interval]]s)

Some types of statistical inference problems:

!!!__[[Parametric statistical inference]]__

When one is trying to estimate a finite set of [[Parameter]]s, parametrizing a family of [[Probability distribution]]s, one of which one assumes describes the population being studied.

* [[Point estimation]], aka statistical estimation
* [[Interval estimation]]

!!!__[[Statistical hypothesis testing]]__

!!!__[[Nonparametric statistics]]__

One doesn't make assumption that the population is described by a parametrized family of distributions, but by a more general class.

__Sampling without replacement__

This changes things if the sample size is close to the total population size. Now, samples are not totally independent!

!!!__Statistical learning__

//aka [[predictive inference|https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Predictive_inference]]//

Particular classes of statistical inference problems, where we attempt to infer ("learn") functions that allow one to make predictions about future data <small>(so we are interested in inferring things about the population that allow us to predict certain other things, while in other statistical inference problems, the aim of inferring the things may be different (for e.g. estimating a parameter as accurately as possible), and therefore the measure of success may be difference)</small>
