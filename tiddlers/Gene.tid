A ''gene'' is [[discrete unit of inheritance|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6gwYdyn7II#t=0m40s]], corresponding to a particular portion of DNA in a chromosome that codes for a protein belonging to a certain family (that may then have some function in an organism or a cell). Every gene is identified with a particular protein, and viceversa (in standard biology).
