At times long compared to the rotational diffusion time, rotational diffusion leads to a randomization of the direction of propulsion, and the particle undergoes a random walk whose step length is the product of the propelled velocity V and the rotational diffusion time, leading to a substantial enhancement of the effective diffusion coefficient
