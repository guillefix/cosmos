__(Abstract) Rewrite systems__

A set of objects, and a binary operation, $$\rightarrow$$, that tells us how we are allowed to transforms expressions. If these rules act on //terms// out of which an expression can be built, then this is a term rewrite system.

They are non-deterministic Markov algorithms, and they are Turing complete. They are related to normal forms, lambda calculus, and combinatory logic
