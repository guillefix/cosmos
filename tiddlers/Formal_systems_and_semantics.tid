[[Semantics]] -- the study of [[Meaning]]. Hofstadter argues that meaning is a [[Morphism]] (often an [[Isomorphism]]) between a [[language|Formal language]] (produced by a [[Formal system]]) and another space. The mapping itself is known as an interpretation.

''Meaningfull'' interpretations are those where there is an identifications between the theorems and non-theorems of the [[Formal system]], and a pair of sets that correspond to some aspects of [[Reality]], for instance a set of true and false statements. See page 51 of [[GEB|Godel, Escher, Bach]]. An interpretation is otherwise known as //meaningless//.

//symbols of a formal system, though initally without meaning, cannot avoid taking on "meaning" of sorts, at least if an isomorphism is found.// However, unlike [[Natural language]] and other non-[[Formal system]]s, we can't add new rules or axioms because the meaning we have found; by definition of //formality//, the rules are fixed. To distinguish these we call these active and passive [[Meaning]]s
