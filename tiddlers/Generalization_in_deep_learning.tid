They are very related to sharpness/robustness analysis. They look at how many of the ReLU activations are changed by small changes to the weights, to bound what they call the //sharpness//, which bounds the generalization error via a [[PAC-Bayes]] bound (on parameter space, of course..). Similar for some of the compression-based bounds, although in that case they use a [[Covering number]] argument rather than a PAC-Bayes one

Bounds are not very good usually, as they suffer from exponential dependence on dimension ([[Curse of dimensionality]]).

"For fully connected networks with single output, Theorem 1 shows that there is no effect of depth on the implicit bias of gradient descent. Regardless of the depth of the network, the asymptotic classifier is always the hard margin support vector machine classifier, which is also the limit direction of gradient descent for linear logistic regression in the direct parameterization of β = w. In contrast, next we show that for convolutional networks we get very different biases. Let us first look at a 2–layer linear convolutional network, i.e., a network with single convolutional layer followed by a fully connected final layer."

Hmm but for matrix facorization, they did get differences? is it only about [[rank|Matrix rank]]?
What about for non linearly separable data?
In any case changing the way we parametrize can have an effect in general, clearly

"Results for matrix sensing in [[Gunasekar et al. [8]|https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7195-implicit-regularization-in-matrix-factorization]] imply that for two layer
fully connected networks with multiple outputs, the implicit bias is to a maximum margin solution
with respect to the nuclear norm kβk?. This is already different from the implicit bias of a one-layer
“network” (i.e. optimizing β directly), which would be in terms of the Frobenius norm kβkF . We
suspect that with multiple outputs, as more layers are added, even fully connected networks exhibit a
shrinking sparsity penalty on the singular values of the effective linear matrix predictor β ∈ R
C×D."

<small> it might be beneficial to continue optimizing even
after the loss value L(β
(t)
) itself becomes negligible.</small>

<small>"We can decompose the characterization of implicit bias of gradient descent on a parameterization
P(w) into two parts: (a) what is the implicit bias of gradient descent in the space of parameters w?,
and (b) what does this imply in term of the linear predictor β = P(w), i.e., how does the bias in
parameter space translate to the linear predictor learned from the model class?"</small>

This is not surprising. The striking feature is that there exist other tasks for which increasing network size improves generalization. We give an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the information entropy. I think what this paper is missing is the concept of universal complexity measures. You can see that tasks of “medium complexity” are the hardest to learn, because their measure of complexity isn’t very good. Even just entropy, would be better (as highest entropy corresponds to medium complexity in their case)
