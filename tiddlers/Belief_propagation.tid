title: Belief propagation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Belief propagation'' can describe a particular kind of [[Message-passing process]] in [[Network]]s, and the related algorithm for performing [[Inference]] in [[Conditional random field]]s.

* The forward-backward algorithm of CRFs is a special case, it is belief propagation for the linear chain case. Belief propagation yields exact inference if the CRF graph is a [[tree|Tree (combinatorial structure)]], by computing marginals.

* On graphs with loops, belief propagation can be used to do approximate inference. But one has to be careful with divergences (c.f. infinities in [[Quantum field theory]], and loops in [[Feynman diagram]]s).
