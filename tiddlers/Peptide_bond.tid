A bond formed by [[Dehydration synthesis]] between a [[Carboxylic acid]] group, and an [[Amine]] group. These are the basis of polypeptides, such as [[Protein]]s

The nature of the chemical bonding within a peptide accounts for the bondâ€™s planarity. The bond resonates between a single bond and a double bond. Because of this double-bond character, rotation about this bond is prevented

There are two possible conformations, the //cis// and //trans// conformations, but, for [[Amino acid]], due to to [[Steric hindrance]], the trans is by far the most common. for X-Pro bonds, both have steric hindrance and so both kinds appear.
