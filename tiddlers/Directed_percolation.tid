title: Directed percolation

[[Percolation]] on a directed [[Network|Network science]]. Most of the time, it refers to percolation on a directed lattice where the direction of the edges is constrained to certain directions in the space. This is applied for instance to water percolating down a porous medium, where in this case gravity imposes a preferred direction.

It is in a different universality class than undirected bond percolation. It can be described by an [[stochastic process|Stochastic processes]] similar to models describing [[Epidemics on networks]].
