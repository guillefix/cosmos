title: Active matter

''Active matter'' refers to a type of [[bulk matter|Bulk matter]], often [[soft condensed matter|Soft matter physics]] that is an [[Active system]], i.e. that it produces its own driving energy (for example, [[self-propelling particles|Self-propelled particle]], and micro-swimmers).

[[Driven matter]] is a closely related type of matter, where the system is externally driven.

Swimming at low Reynolds number: ''Stokes equation''

Important consequence for swimmers: ''Scallop theorem'' (see [[Kinematic reversibility in fluid dynamics]])

__Swimmer models__

!!!__''Far-flow fields''__

,,Used to calculate __hydrodynamic interactions__, for instance,,

Point-force problem for Stokes equation, can be solved using its Green function, often called the ''Oseen tensor'' (see [[here|http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6231v1.pdf]]):

<big>$$G_{ij}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{8\pi \mu} \left(\frac{\delta_{ij}}{|\vec{r}|}+\frac{r_i r_j}{|\vec{r}|^3}\right)$$</big>

,,where the $$\frac{1}{8\pi \mu}$$ is often omitted in the definition of the Oseen tensor.,,

Using the Green function to construct general solution, one can construct a ''multipole expansion''. As swimmers (in average, in steady state) don't accelerate, the fluid isn't exerting a net force on them, so they can't be exerting a net force on the fluid ([[Netwon's third law]]). Therefore the monopole term (called the ''Stokelet'') isn't present. ,,An exception for this is the relatively large microorganism //Volvox//, for which gravity force is significant, giving a net force to the problem and creating a Stokelet flow,,. Therefore, the dominant term is generally the ''dipolar'' term:

$$v_i (\vec{r}) \approx \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x_k} (\vec{r}) D_{jk}$$

where $$v_i (\vec{r})$$ is the velocity field, and

$$D_{jk} = - \int f_j \xi_k d\vec{\xi}$$

It is conventional to let:

$$D_{jk} \rightarrow D_{jk} -\frac{1}{3}D_{ii} \delta_{jk} \equiv S_{jk} + T_{jk}$$

where the addition of $$\frac{1}{3}D_{ii}$$ doesn't change the velocity field $$v_i (\vec{r})$$ because $$\vec{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{G} = \vec{0}$$. $$S_{jk}$$ is called the ''stresslet'', and $$T_{jk}$$ is called the ''rotlet''. The rotlet is zero if the net torque on the fluid is zero, which it is for active microswimmers.

Note that the dipolar flow has __nematic symmetry__; this is important in the collective behavior of active swimmers.

We can have two __kinds of dipolar flow__ around a swimmer:

* ''pusher'', or ''extensive'' <span style="color:Dodgerblue"><i class="fa fa-long-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>. Like that of the //E. Coli//

* Microswimmers moving in a viscoelastic medium. Living liquid crystals represent a novel system where bacteria swim in a nematic liquid.

* Biological systems (see [[Biological matter]]):

**molecular motors walking along microtubules contribute to cell division resulting from spindle mitosis.

**cytoplasmic streaming, flow driven by the motion of motors along the cell walls, presumably to aid the transport of nutrients around the cell.

** The extent to which hydrodynamics (even at nanometre scales) affects motor motion [74], the way in which multiple motors can combine to move cargo and mechanisms for cargo transport in the crowded cellular environment remain largely unexplored.

** there is increasing evidence that cell motility is linked to the physical environment. Interactions between cells, the spreading of cellular layers and the possible role of flow in [[Morphogenesis]] are also of interest.
