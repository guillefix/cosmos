In general, a curve refers to a [[differentiable|Differentiable function]] [[Continuous path]] from an interval of [[the reals|Real number]] to a [[Differentiable manifold]]

However, if the codomain manifold is not specified, one often assumes it refers to a ''spatial curve'', that is a curve in [[R^3|Euclidean space]] (that is codomain is $$\mathbb{R}^3$$)

[[Definition of regular curve|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKlfCLsFzUY]], as opposed to singular ones, which may have [[Cusp]]s and nodes. They have [[arc length parametrization|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKlfCLsFzUY#t=13m22s]] (p.a.l). They have [[no intrinsic geometry|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKlfCLsFzUY#t=32m]]

: A ''curve'' is a [[differentiable|Differentiable function]] [[Continuous path]] from an interval of [[the reals|Real number]] to [[R^3|Euclidean space]], $$x(t)$$. The curve is regular if $$x'(t) \neq 0$$ for all $$t$$.

[[basis|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKlfCLsFzUY#t=35m]] ([[Frenet trihedron]]). The derivative of the [[Tangent vector]] $$T$$ is orthogonal to the tangent vector. The norm of this vector $$k=|T'|$$ is the ''curvature'' of the curve at the point. The ''normal vector'' is the normalized version of this vector $$N=T'/k$$. To complete the basis we introduce the ''binormal vector'' $$B=T \times N$$. The magnitude of the derivative of the binormial vector defines the ''torsion''.  One can then derive [[Frenet formulae]]

The [[Fundamental theorem of the local theory of curves|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beA5jKtQdgU#t=5m50s]] states that given two smooth functions, $$k(s) > 0$$ and $$\tau(s)$$, there exists a curve $$\alpha(s)$$ p.a.l., such that its curvature is $$k$$ and its torsion is $$\tau$$. Moreover, $$\alpha$$ is unique (up to direct isometries (rigid motions of $$R^3$$, with determinant $$1$$))
