title: Virgo Supercluster

The Virgo Supercluster (Virgo SC) or the Local Supercluster (LSC or LS), one of the millions of superclusters, is a mass concentration of galaxies that contains the Virgo Cluster in addition to the Local Group, which in turn contains the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy.

A 2014 study indicates that the Virgo Supercluster is only a lobe of a greater supercluster, [[Laniakea|Laniakea Supercluster]], which is centered on the Great Attractor.
