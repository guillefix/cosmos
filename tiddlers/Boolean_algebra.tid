title: Boolean algebra

A ''Boolean algebra'' is an [[Algebraic structure]] that models the relations between elements which can be either true or false. It is important in [[Mathematical logic]] and in [[Computer science]].

It has the structure of an orthocomplemented, distributed [[Lattice (algebraic structure)]].
