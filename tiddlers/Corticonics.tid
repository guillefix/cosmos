The study of the foundamtental computations that are applied through out the cortex

Classification of cortical areas according to structural and functional differences cannot in itself bring about an understanding of the common operations con-ducted by the cortex and the manner in which they are carried out. Corticonics is the study of these common processes and their underlying neural mechanisms.
