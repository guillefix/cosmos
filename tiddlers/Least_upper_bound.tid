title: Least upper bound

Natural extension of the [[join|Join operation]] of two elements to an arbitrary [[Set]] of elements of a [[poset|Partially ordered set]]

Interpreting the [[Partial ordering]] as "less than or equal", it can be understood as the least point that is greater than or equal to all the points in the set.
