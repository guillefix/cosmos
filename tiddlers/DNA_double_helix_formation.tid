It is easy to see that double helix formation decreases entropy, as the two joined strands are contrained to move together. However, the reaction is spontaneous due to the release of [[Heat]], about -250 mJ $$mol^{-1}$$! (see [[Chemical energetics]])

[[Acid-base reaction]]s that remove or donate protons at specific positions on the DNA bases can disrupt the double helix. Therfore, at [[pH]] above 9-10, and below about 5, DNA separates back into its single stranded form.
