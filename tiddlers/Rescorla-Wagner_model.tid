Rescorla and Wagner created their model mainly to account for blocking. The core
idea of the Rescorlaâ€“Wagner model is that an animal only learns when events violate
its expectations, in other words, only when the animal is surprised (although with-
out necessarily implying any conscious expectation or emotion).

It can be interpreted as [[Stochastic gradient descent]] to minimize the expected square error of a linear model between stimuli and responses (where the true response is determined by the unconditioned stimulus)
