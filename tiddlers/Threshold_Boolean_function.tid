A [[Linearly separable]] [[Boolean function]].

The number of threshold Boolean functions for a given input dimension $$n$$ is nontrivial to calculate. See [[here|https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/18056/how-many-presentable-boolean-functions-with-n-attributes-are-linear-separable]], and [[here|http://oeis.org/A000609]], and [[here|http://oeis.org/A002077/a002077.pdf]], and this thesis: [[Linear Separability Of The Vertices Of An n-Dimensional Hypercube|http://unbc.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A15882/datastream/PDF/download/citation.pdf]]

Similar to what I've been thinking about. For instance the function which maps all to 1s is easy to specify, by saying all basis vectors are mapped to 1, while functions with some 1s and some 0s require more labelled examples. There is also the question of not just the minimum number of examples,  but the typical number of examples, under some distribution, until learner is sure of the function, or reaches a certain confidence. This is just [[Learning theory]]/[[Generalization]], etc...
