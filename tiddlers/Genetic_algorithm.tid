As a result, uniformly redundant representations do not change the behavior of GAs. Only by increasing r, which means overrepresenting the optimal solution, does GA performance increase. Therefore, non-uniformly redundant representations can only be used advantageously if a-priori information exists regarding the optimal solution.

Bias towards simplicity (see [[MMathPhys oral presentation]]) similar to regularization in [[Machine learning]]?
