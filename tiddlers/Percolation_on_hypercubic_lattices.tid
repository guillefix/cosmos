title: Percolation on hypercubic lattices

[[Percolation]] on hypercubic lattices, which can be represented as $$\mathbb{Z}^d$$, where $$d$$ is the dimension of the lattice, and $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is the set of integers of course.

Some mathematical results exist for [[Percolation threshold]]s, and [[Continuity of percolation phase transition]]. In particular, it is known that the percolation threshold at dimension $$d$$ is greater than or equal that of dimension $$d+1$$ for percolation on $$\mathbb{Z}^d$$.
