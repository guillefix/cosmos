See definition and examples [[here|https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/view_material/33583#page=8]]. An ''abstract simplicial complex'' $$K$$ is just a set of points and subsets of these points satisfying some simple conditions. Its ''topological realization'', denoted $$|K|$$, is a corresponding [[Topological space]] gotten from the disjoint union of simplices associated with these subsets, quotient certain inclusion relations (similar but not the same as [[Delta-complex]]es).

We also define a [[Triangulation]] of a space, as well as [[Simplicial map]]s between simplicial complexes.

A more flexible way of constructing topological spaces are [[CW complex]]es.

Can be used to calculate [[Fundamental group]]s

-----------

Traditionally, simplicial homology is defined for simplicial complexes, which are
the [[âˆ† complexes|Delta-complex]] whose simplices are uniquely determined by their vertices. This
amounts to saying that each n simplex has n + 1 distinct vertices, and that no other
n simplex has this same set of vertices.
