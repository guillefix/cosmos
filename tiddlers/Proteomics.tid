The experimental and [[bioinformatic|Bioinformatic]] analysis of the [[Proteome]] of from living organisms.

* [[Mass spectrometry]]. One of the most sensitive techniques, whereby mass-charge ratios are determined by accelerating charged proteins to known speeds into a magnetic field, so that the radius of their circular trajectory indicates the mass-charge ratio. Depending on where the proteins are detected on a screen, we can get information of the radius of its trajectories. We also get information of their concentration from the intensity of the signal.

* [[Chromatography]]

------------

For protein analysis, referred to as proteomics, the
most relevant experimental approach is based on a shotgun ap-
proach where proteins are proteolytically digested into peptides of
~8–​30 amino acids in length, for which mass spectrometers have
greatest sensitivity, and for which sequencing information can be
obtained directly via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/​MS, Fig. 25.1).
This in combination with refined sample preparation protocols cap-
able of handling small cellular tissue or body fluid samples including
prefractionation have resulted in wider proteome coverage.
