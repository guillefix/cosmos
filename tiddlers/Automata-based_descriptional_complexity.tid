A computable class of [[Descriptional complexity]] measures, based on [[automata|Automata theory]]

!!__Automatic complexity__

[[Automatic complexity of strings|https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Papers/auto5.pdf]] smallest number of states of a DFA (deterministic finite automaton) that acceptsxand does not accept any other string of length |x|. Note that a DFA recognizing the singleton language {x} always needs |x|+1 states, which is the reason the definition considers only strings of length |x|.

[[Automaticity II|https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/paper113.pdf]]

is an analogous descriptional complexity measure as Automatic complexity but for languages.

!!__Finite state dimension__

The finite-state dimension is defined in terms of computations of finite transducers on infinite sequences,

Finite state complexity defines smallest length of input that will produce result under finite transducer (finite state machine with output basically, which i think can describe the GP maps). Then we can apply Ards argument of how many ways of fitting this shortest string in the fixed-length input of interest (say the genotype). This could be the beginning of the formal theory we need! We probably would also want to develop a concept of algorithmic probability (like Salomonoff's) for finite state machines.

!!!__NFA based complexity__

[[Approximating the smallest grammar: Kolmogorov complexity in natural models|http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=510021]]. ,,However, the model allows the advice strings to be over an arbitrary alphabet with no penalty in terms of complexity and, as observed in [8], consequently the NFAs used for compression can always be assumed to consist of only one state... (so not very good measure).,,
