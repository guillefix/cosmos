//How things move//

A space (in the mathematical sense, for a continuous space, one often uses a [[Manifold]], or a [[Topological space]]), with a [[Function]] (a.k.a. a map) that describes how a point in the space evolves (in "time").

!!__Types of dynamical systems__

[[Measure-theoretical dynamical system]]

[[Topological dynamical system]]

''[[Continuous dynamical system]]'' are dynamical systems where the space is continuous. It is often represented as a system of 1st order O.D.Es. Linear dynamical systems (O.D.E.s linear) are easy to analyze, and can be analyzed by looking at the eigenvalues of the Jacobian.

[[Discrete dynamical system]] are those where the space is discrete. They are often represented as systems of difference equations (see [[Nonlinear maps]]).

[[Measure-theoretical dynamical system]]

[[Topological dynamical system]]

The richest class of dynamical systems are [[Nonlinear system]]s

A dynamical system, whether continuous or discrete, can be partitioned (''coarse-grained''), so that its dynamics can be studied as [[Symbolic dynamics]]. If the system is a [[Probabilistic dynamical system]], then the coarse-graining gives rise to a [[stochastic process|Stochastic processes]]

!!__Deterministic vs probabilistic dynamics__

Dynamical systems generally describe deterministic processes. Probabilistic processes are described as [[Stochastic processes]]. However, these can sometimes be described as deterministic dynamics of probability distributions, or as a probability measure over a deterministic process (i.e. a [[Probabilistic dynamical system]]).
