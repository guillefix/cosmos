https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porous_medium

A porous medium or a porous material is a material containing pores (voids). The skeletal portion of the material is often called the "matrix" or "frame"

A porous material most often refers to ''porous solids'', i.e. porous materials where the matrix is a solid.

If the porosity of a porous solid is high enough, it is also falls under the category of [[Foam]]s, and many of these are very flexible materials.

-----------

Solid-gas [[Dispersed media]] do form materials with pores, but they are different from porous solids in that the location of these pores can change as the material is strained or disturbed in some way.
