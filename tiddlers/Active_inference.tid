We have shown recently that adaptive behaviour can be prescribed by prior expectations about sensory inputs, which action tries to fulfill [6]. This is calledactive inference

See [[Free energy principle]], [[Inference]], [[Machine learning]], [[Reinforcement learning]]

Essentially, active inference replaces value-learning with perceptual learning that optimises empirical (acquired) priors in the agentâ€™s internal model of its world. These priors specify the free energy associated with sensory signals and guide action to ensure sensations conform to prior beliefs.
