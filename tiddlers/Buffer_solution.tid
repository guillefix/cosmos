title: Buffer solution

//aka buffer//

A buffer solution (more precisely, pH buffer or hydrogen ion buffer) is an aqueous solution consisting of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or vice versa. Its pH changes very little when a small or moderate amount of strong acid or base is added to it and thus it is used to prevent changes in the pH of a solution.

Buffers are important in biology, as they help avoid very acidic or very basic solutions, where the function of biological molecules may be altered, and be lethal for the cell.

A buffer is most effective when the [[pH]] is close to the [[pKa|Acid-base equilibria]] of its acid component 

!!__Henderson-Hasselbach equation__

Using $$[A^-]+ [HA] = C$$ is a constant, which is the total concentration of HA before dissociating.

gives 

$$\frac{C}{(\frac{K_a}{[H^+]}+1)}=[HA]$$

Well I think I need also the water equilibrium equation, etc. really.
