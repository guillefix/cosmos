A resonance or mesomerism is a way of describing delocalized electrons within certain molecules or polyatomic ions where the bonding cannot be expressed by one single Lewis structure. A molecule or ion with such delocalized electrons is represented by several contributing structures[2] (also called ''resonance structures'' or canonical structures).

These are found, for instance, in [[Aromatic compound]]s, like [[Benzene]]
