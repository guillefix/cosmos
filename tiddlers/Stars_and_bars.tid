__Theorem 1__

For any pair of positive integers n and k, {the number of k-tuples of positive integers whose sum is n} is equal to {the number of (k − 1)-element subsets of a set with n − 1 elements}, which is given by $$\binom{n-1}{k-1}$$

See [[Number of ways to put n objects in k bins, with each having at least one object]]

__Theorem 2__

For any pair of positive integers n and k, the number of k-tuples of non-negative integers whose sum is n is equal to the number of multisets of cardinality k − 1 taken from a set of size n + 1, which is given by the ''multiset number'', $$\left(\binom{n+1}{k-1}\right) = \binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$$.
