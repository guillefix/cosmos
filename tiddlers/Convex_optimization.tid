//aka convex programming//

''Convex optimization'' refers to an [[Optimization]] problem in which the objective and constraint functions are both [[convex|Convex function]]. This implies that the domain of the optimization variable is a convex set. The convexity property can make optimization in some sense "easier" than the general case - for example, any local minimum must be a global minimum. It is a generalization of [[Linear programming]]

Convex optimization problems include least-squares fitting (see [[Linear regression]]), and [[Linear programming]] problems.
