''Fluid dynamics'' is the branch of [[Fluid mechanics]] that describes the causes of motion, i.e. the forces and torques that can affect fluids, and how these affect their motion. 

The equations of fluid dynamics can be derived from the principles of [[Mechanics]] (in particular continuum mechanics). More recently they have also been derived from the microscopic statistical picture of moving and interacting particles thanks to the development of [[Kinetic theory]].
