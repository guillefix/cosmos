type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//a.k.a. algorithmic probability, Levin's probability distribution, universal prior//

Probability distribution of outputs of a [[Turing machine]], when fed random inputs. Apparently, the distribution is rather robust to the probability distribution of inputs, thus it being called "universal"

: [img[http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nSFgWgn3L._SS36_.jpg]] Imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard and typing the keys at random.

::Probability of an input program (string), $$p$$, is $$2^{-l(p)}$$. <big><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></big>simple strings are more likely than complicated strings of the same length.

__Universality of the universal probability__

Remark. <b>Bounded likelihood ratio</b> The likelihood ratio $$P_{\mathcal{U}}(x)/P_{\mathcal{A}}(x)$$ is bounded, and doesn't go to $$0$$ or $$\infty$$ for any $$x$$, thus no universal probability can be totally discarded relative to any other in hypothesis testing. This is essentially because any universal computer can simulate any other, and //in that sense// the probability distribution obtained by feeding random input into one is also contained in the distribution obtained in the other.

In that sense we cannot reject the possibility that the universe
is the output of monkeys typing at a computer. However, we can reject
the hypothesis that the universe is random (monkeys with no computer). <big><big>😮</big></big>

The example indicates that a random input to a computer is much more
likely to produce “interesting” outputs than a random input to a typewriter.
We all know that a computer is an intelligence amplifier. Apparently, it
creates sense from nonsense as well.

__On the machine dependence of UP__

<<<

That Algorithmic Probability was relatively independent of the choice of
which universal machine was used seemed likely but was not altogether cer
tain. It was clear that probabilities assigned by different machines would differ
by only a constant factor (independent of length of data described), but this
constant factor could be
quite large.

Fortunately, in just about all applications of probability, we are not in
terested in absolute probabilities, but only in probability ratios. I had some
heuristic arguments to the effect that the probability ratio for alternative possi
ble continuations of a sequence should be relatively machine independent if the
sequence were very long
The second half of the 1964 paper was devoted to examples of how this prob-
ability evaluation method could be applied. That it seemed to give reasonable
answers was some of the strongest evidence that I had for its correctness

[ext[The discovery of algorithmic probability|http://world.std.com/~rjs/barc97.pdf]]. See also [[Universal inductive inference]]. Solomonoff defined 5 models which are variants of UP, discussed in that paper. They are based on different constraints on the Turing machine, and on defining probability in a frequentist way. Some of them were used for sequence prediction.

See [[here (vid)|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMcRMO9ejeM#t=4m41s]] for description of these.
