See [[here|http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/12/28/097170.full.pdf]]. Individual place cells correspond to places/states. However, their activation patterns correspond to the places/states that one is most likely to visit in the future (in a discounted way, see paper). This is the [[Successor representation]]

__Hippocampal replay__

Replay of remembered or imagined trajectories

We will probe the role of hippocampal replay events in learning the structure of state spaces by assessing whether the frequency and content of such events is influenced on encountering changes in the maze structure, and test for a causal role of such events in structure learning using closed loop optogenetic inhibition of the hippocampus during sharp waves.
