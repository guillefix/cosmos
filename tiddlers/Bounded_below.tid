We say that a subset $$A_0$$ of a [[Partially ordered set]] $$A$$ is ''bounded below'' if there is an element $$a$$ of $$A$$ such that $$a\leq x$$ for every $$x \in A_0$$; the element $$a$$ is called a [[Lower bound]] for $$A_0$$. If the set of all upper bounds for $$A_0$$ has a [[Largest element]], that element is called the ''greatest upper bound'', or the [[Infimum]], of $$A_0$$. It is denoted by $$\inf{A_0}$$; it may or may not belong to $$A_0$$. If it does, it is the smallest element of $$A_0$$.
