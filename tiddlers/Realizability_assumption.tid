There exists h âˆˆ H (hypothesis in the [[Hypothesis class]]) s.t.
L ( D , f ) (h ) = 0 (the [[Empirical error]] is zero. Note that this assumption implies that with probability 1 over ran-
dom samples, S, where the instances of S are sampled according to D and are labeled
by f , we have L S (h ) = 0.
