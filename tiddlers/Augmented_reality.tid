I agree that AR is pretty close now. In fact I think the plot I posted shows the typical Gartner cycle where AR is now on the slope of engligthenment. 

What does AR give? A much more intuitive and powerful (in terms of UI) computing plataform, that furthermore is inherently full of data about the real world. This will make at least three changes:
* Several uses of computers will become easier and more accessible, so more people will do them. Things like interactive programming, media editing, education, exploration, and other things which should just be described as "magic".
* The real-world data will also allow much more prevalent use of computers for measuring stuff about the real world. Useful knowledge about for instance how big/heavy something is, how far something is, where is such street in this big map in front of me (real-life ctrl+f), if this tree fell, what would it hit? what color is this? and more stuff as more sensors are added.
* Health. Using computers by tipping on and constraining our vision to this little square thing while sitting all day is not a healthy thing. AR will allow more healthy use of computers.
