title: Descriptional complexity
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

//What is the shortest description of an object?// The size of this description, is the ''descriptional complexity''. This general notion may also be called "structural complexity".

See also [[Complexity theory]], for other notions of complexity.

Based on the minimum size of a program (interpreted by a [[Turing machine]]) that produces (//describes//) the object.
