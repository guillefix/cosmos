[[Definition of VC dimension|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kWZoyNRxTY&index=10&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599#t=13m50s]]

the VC dimension (for Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis dimension) is a measure of the capacity (complexity, expressive power, richness, or flexibility) of a space of functions that can be learned by a statistical classification algorithm. It is defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter.

In $$n$$-dimensions, the VC dimension of the set of all linear classifiers is $$n+1$$
