[[Definition of VC dimension|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kWZoyNRxTY&index=10&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599#t=13m50s]]

the VC dimension (for Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis dimension) is a measure of the capacity (complexity, expressive power, richness, or flexibility) of a space of functions that can be learned by a statistical classification algorithm. It is defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter.

In $$n$$-dimensions, the VC dimension of the set of all linear classifiers is $$n+1$$

See also [[Probably approximately correct]], [[Learning theory]]

See [[Probably approximately correct]] for context.

What happens when $$H$$ or $$C$$ is infinite?

Let $$S \subseteq X$$, define  $$\Pi_C(S) = \{c_S \mid c \in C\}$$ (i.e. the concept class of concepts in $$C$$, but restricted to the subset of $$X$$, $$S$$. The size of $$\Pi_C$$ $$\leq 2^m$$, where $$m$$ is the size of $$S$$.

This is used to define a measure of concept class complexity: [[VC dimension]] (Vapnik-Chervonenkis):

> We say $$S \subseteq X$$ is shattered by $$C$$, if $$|\Pi_C(S)| = 2^{|S|}$$
> ''VC dimension'' of $$C$$ is the cardinality of the largest set shattered by $$C$$ (If $$C$$ shatters arbitrarily large sets, VC-dim is $$\infty$$).

__intervals__

$$X=\mathbb{R}$$

$$C$$ is intervals over $$\mathbb{R}$$, where $$x$$ in intervals are assigned $$1$$ and those outside $$0$$.

Can have interval that assigns anything to 1, and 2 points, but not for 3 points (+-+). This implies that the VC dimension of the class of intervals is 2.

__rectangles__

there is __a__ set of 4 points that can be shattered by rectangles. However, there is no set of 5 points that is shattered by rectangles, because there is always a point within the extreme left, right, top, bottom.

__Linear halfspaces or LTF (Linear threshold functions)__

Like [[Support vector machine]]s.

VC dimension is n+1 for n dimensional space, (in 2 dimensions, it is 3).
