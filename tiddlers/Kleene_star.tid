A [[Kleene star|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star]], in [[Mathematical logic]] and [[Computer science]], (or Kleene operator or Kleene closure) is a unary operation, either on sets of strings or on sets of symbols or characters.

If V is a set of symbols or characters then V* is the set of all finite strings over symbols in V, including the empty string Îµ.

It is often used in [[Coding theory]], [[Formal language]] theory, etc.
