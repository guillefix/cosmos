A learning principle that can be viewed as approximating the expected value of the output from a model, using [[Bayesian statistics]], by only considering the hypothesis with maximum a-posteriori probability (the most likely).

It can be seen as formally equivalent to [[Maximum likelihood]] by multiplying the likelihood by the prior (adds the log of the prior to the log likelihood).
