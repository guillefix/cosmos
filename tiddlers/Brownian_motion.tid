!!__Discrete space: ''random walk''__

[[Random walk on 1D lattice|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn6wzdRAdiE&index=1&list=PL04QVxpjcnjjDk2ESwBZ1sEcKu91wDV5l#t=27m55s]]

[[Biased random walk]], probability distribution is Binomial

__Limits in time variable__

*Discrete time and space: discrete time [[Master equation]]

* [[continuous time limit, but keeping space discrete|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfK1y3YRSxE&list=PL04QVxpjcnjjDk2ESwBZ1sEcKu91wDV5l&index=3#t=30m00s]], we get the continuous time [[Master equation]].

A discrete space-time random walk has a standard deviation in position that is proportional to square root of number of steps: 

$$\frac{\sigma_x}{a}=\sqrt{n}=\sqrt{\frac{t}{\tau}}$$

$$\sigma_x=\frac{a}{\sqrt{\tau}}\sqrt{t}$$

Clearly if we want $$\sigma_x$$ to stay finite for a finite $$t$$, we want $$\frac{a}{\sqrt{\tau}}$$ to stay finite, and we get $$\sigma_x\propto\sqrt{t}$$ in continuous limit. We also get non-differentiable paths as $$\frac{a}{\tau}\rightarrow \infty$$.

__[[Polya's recurrence theorem|https://math.dartmouth.edu/~pw/math100w13/mare.pdf]] for random walks__

See also probability distribution for random walk (same as for polymer) [For example [[here|http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/ArdLouis/teaching/L4-B1-BIOPHYSICS-Notes3-AAL-Nov2015.pdf]] or in Soft Matter Physics notes. The probability density at origin goes like $$1/N^{d/2}$$ (normalization of Gaussian). One can then sum over all possible lengths of time (i.e. $$N$$s) and get the expected number of times one returns to (a neighbourhood of) the origin (See Note 1 in [[Probability theory]] for why). For $$d=1,2$$, this is $$\infty$$, while it's finite for $$d \geq 3$$. This can be interpreted for a polymer as it being "dense" or "sparse", as summing over $$N$$ we are asking the question how many monomers of our very long polymer are close to a given point (say the origin)?

One can also find __probability of //ever// coming back__, and this [[can be related to|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut9tv2O87Vk&list=PL04QVxpjcnjjDk2ESwBZ1sEcKu91wDV5l&index=5#t=1h12m30s]] __the expected number of times to come back__. [[This can also be derived heuristically for the asymptotic limit of large times|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHciEDpm1sE&index=9&list=PL04QVxpjcnjjDk2ESwBZ1sEcKu91wDV5l#t=30m42s]].

__First passage time__: [[First passage time calculation using generating functions.|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHciEDpm1sE&index=9&list=PL04QVxpjcnjjDk2ESwBZ1sEcKu91wDV5l#t=38m32s]]. The generating functions also give the {survival probability}, which is the same as {probability of ever coming back}.

Can also have continuous space, and discrete time, although not often used.
