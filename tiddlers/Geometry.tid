//Things often have a shape//

What is ''space''? Well, it can be Euclidean, but it may also be non-Euclidean, and have curvature!

//one can let the meanings of "point" and "line", and so on be determined by the set of theorems (or propositions) in which they occur//. These are called //undefined terms//, and they only get meaning through these theorems.
