title: Likelihood function

[[Likelihood function|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function]], $$\mathcal{L} $$ is defined as

$$\mathcal{L} = \text{P}(\text{data}|\text{theory})$$

I.e. the probability of the data given the theory.

One often considers the log-likelihood, which is just the log of the likelihood.
