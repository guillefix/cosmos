Over and over again we see a pattern like this:

nonlinear ----------linearize & iterate-----------> LINEAR

PDE ------------discretize-------------> ALGEBRA

Because of this, computers have brought linear algebra, and numerical linearalgebra, to the forefront of the mathematical sciences.

Standard algorithms to ''solve linear system'' $$Ax = b$$, i.e. matrix inversion, grow like $$O(N^3)$$. To improve this one can:

* use ''parallel computing'', or 
* algorithms to ''take advantage of sparsity of matrix'' (many entries are zero)

In recent years flop count is less and less important at the high end (i.e. for many processors) â€“ communication is a bigger bottleneck.
