The reactivity series allows us to predict how metals will react. A more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from a compound.

A more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from a compound. 

The [[Thermite reaction]] is a good example of this. It is used to produce white hot molten (liquid) iron for [[Welding]]

!!__Displacement reactions of solutions__

A more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal from a solution of one of its salts.
