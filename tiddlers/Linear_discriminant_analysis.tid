title: Linear discriminant analysis
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Gaussian discriminant analysis]] where the covariant matrices are the same for all classes, but the means are different. Reduces the number of parameters, which may prevent [[Overfitting]].

The decision boundaries are linear unlike in GDA

The predictivion distribution $$p(y|x)$$ has the form of [[Logistic regression]], i.e. a [[Softmax]] with a linear model. The difference is in the training as we have a prior, which we fit also.
