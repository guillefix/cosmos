title: Polar molecule
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A [[Molecule]] with a permanent [[Electric dipole]]. It can refer to a [[Moiety]] too.

The polarity of a molecule really lives on a spectrum (corresponding to the strength of the dipole), dependent on the relative [[Electronegativity]] of the atoms forming a [[Chemical bond]].
