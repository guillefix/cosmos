----------

We used an adaptive curriculum in which training examples for each mini-batch are fetched with fre-
quency proportional to the modelâ€™s current prediction error for the corresponding program. Specif-
ically, we set the sampling frequency using a softmax over average prediction error across all pro-
grams, with configurable temperature.  In [[here|https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06279.pdf]]. This is exactly my advSGD idea...
