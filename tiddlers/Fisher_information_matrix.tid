The ''Fisher information matrix'' (FIM) is the Hessian of the $$\log$$ [[Likelihood function]].

If one [[Taylor expands|Taylor series]] the log-likelihood around a maximum, and keeps only terms up to second-order, we are approximating the peak by a Gaussian peak, and this is what is done to find the FIM

The [[Covariance matrix]] is the inverse of the Fisher matrix.

$$\chi^2$$ can be calculated as $$\chi^2 = \delta F \delta^T$$, where $$F$$ is the FIM, and $$\delta$$ is a small step in parameter space from the maximum of the likelihood.
