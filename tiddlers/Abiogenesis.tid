''[[Abiogenesis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis]]'' or biopoiesis or OoL (''Origins of Life''), is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. [[Self-organization]] is expected to play a major role, both in the origin of life and in its subsequent [[Evolution]].

[[Kauffman talk|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWo7-azGHic]]. Ideas: <b>As evolution progresses it creates new opportunities and richer context for evolution to find evolve further</b>. Function can be defined as that subset of causal effects that contribute to causing a particular goal. In biology that goal is survival. The appropriate language in evolution goes beyond cause and effect, and includes ''enabling''. Organisms are [[Kantian wholes|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWo7-azGHic#t=12m44s]], where the parts exist for and by means of the whole. The rest of the ideas seem to basically say that biology and evolution is too complex to (fully) describe with mathematical laws.
