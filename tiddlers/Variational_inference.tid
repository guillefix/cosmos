Reduces inference to an optimization problem. Inference (short of [[Statistical inference]]), refers to finding some value depending on an a-posteriori distribution in a probabilistic model, like a [[Graphical model]]. However, posterior distributions are often hard to compute explicitly, and an approximate method is needed. One such method consists on finding an approximate representation of the distribution, and minimizing the [[KL divergence|Relative entropy]] with the real distribution, in some way.
