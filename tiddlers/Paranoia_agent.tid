Somo...

Criticism of how we use [[Fantasy]] to fall into [[Delusion]] and ''escape reality''!

One can use fantasy/imagination for good, to explore reality, and seek truth, instead. This is the [[Chaos Magick]] way. Malowi in the story appears as a master in this (and becomes the Ancient Master at the end)..

Cool how Shatoshi Kon mixes reality and fantasy so seamlessly, touching on the meaning of [[Reality]], as [[Serial Experiments Lain]].

When the girl confronts reality, taking reponsability of her actions. She emerges from the huge delusion, now represented as a huge dark goo/fog, which becomes the [[Sea]] (the sea represents chaos, like in many old cosmogenic [[Myth]]s). And she floats to the surface, as if becoming a new person, and I think making a reference to the very similar scene in [[Ghost in the shell]] (1995 movie).

Cool weird intro with everyone laughing..

Maromi is Shonnen Bato

Shonnen Bato turns out to be just any excuse we put to escape reality. It is the reassuring fable, which we use, instead of confronting the truth, which may be harsh/difficult.
