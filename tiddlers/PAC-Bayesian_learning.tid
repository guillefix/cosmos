An extension of [[Probably approximately correct]] learning to the cases where not all concepts in the concept class are equally likely, but instead have a general probability distribution over them, which can be interpreted as a [[Prior distribution]].

See <big>[ext[here for proof|https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/11wi/scribes/lecture13.pdf]]</big> of general (KL) version. See derivation on blackboard (pic) for connection with Gibbs learner version ([[graph of bounds for KL of binary variables|https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hr4qquya5e]])

This seems to be very related to [[Structural risk minimization]]

To see how the Theorem 1 from 
<small>[[Some PAC-Bayesian Theorems|https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007618624809]]</small> follows from the general theorem below ( <small>[[PAC-Bayes model averaging|http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.46.6957&rep=rep1&type=pdf]]</small> ), see picture of blackboard derivation, or see [[here|https://youtu.be/mxc3jqz2gBE?t=1396]].
