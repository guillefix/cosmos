''Doob martingales''

The [[Balls and bins]] example is a typical Doob martingale. In general, Doob martingales are processes in which we obtain a sequence of improved estimates of the value of a random variable as information about it is revealed progressively. More precisely, suppose that $$Y$$ is a random variable that is a function of random variables $$X_0,X_1,\ldots$$. As we observe the sequence of random variables $$X_0,\ldots,X_n$$, we improve our estimates of $$Y$$. The sequence of the mean estimates

$$ Z_t=E[Y\,|\, X_0,\ldots,X_t], $$

form a martingale with respect to the sequence $$X_0,\ldots,X_n$$ (provided that the $$Z_t$$â€™s are bounded). Indeed, when we argued that the balls and bins process is a martingale, we used no property of the experiment, therefore the following holds in general

$$ E[Z_{t+1} \,|\, X_0,\ldots,X_t] =E[E[Y\,|\, X_0,\ldots,X_t,X_{t+1}] \,|\, $$ $$X_0,\ldots,X_t]] =E[Y\,|\, X_0,\ldots,X_t] =Z_t. $$
