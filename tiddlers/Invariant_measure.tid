title: Invariant measure

a [[Measure]] that is preserved by some [[Function]]

We say that the function $$f: X \rightarrow X$$ preserves a measure $$\mu$$ on $$(X\mathcal{B})$$, if $$\mu(f^{-1} B) = \mu(B)$$, for all $$B \in \mathcal{B}$$. The function is then said to be $$\mu$$-preserving, or $$\mu$$ is said to be $$f$$-invariant.
